WEBVTT

00:05.370 --> 00:06.390
Welcome back.

00:06.420 --> 00:12.060
Now that we've got Visual Studio code installed and the extensions installed, what we're going to do

00:12.060 --> 00:18.890
is create a folder structure so that we can create different projects all within the same root folder.

00:18.900 --> 00:21.630
That's just going to make it very efficient for us to work.

00:21.930 --> 00:25.220
So I've already created a folder and let me show it to you.

00:25.230 --> 00:29.530
It's right on my desktop and I created this folder called Section X.

00:29.550 --> 00:34.050
The idea being if you're working on section one or two or three of the course, you can create your

00:34.050 --> 00:36.990
own Section one, Section two, and Section three folders.

00:36.990 --> 00:39.110
So this could represent any one of them.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.290
It's an empty folder.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.610
There's nothing in there right now.

00:41.610 --> 00:47.940
So what I want to do is I want to open that folder in Visual Studio code so I can choose open folder

00:47.940 --> 00:50.280
or open or I could go to file open.

00:50.280 --> 00:55.800
So I'm just going to click open folder and go to my desktop and select that section x folder.

00:56.480 --> 00:57.560
And I'm going to open it.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.330
So now it's going to open up an X code.

00:59.330 --> 01:02.570
And you can see right here there's the folder, there's nothing inside of it.

01:02.660 --> 01:06.110
We just make this window a little bit wider so we can see it a little bit better.

01:06.470 --> 01:12.530
So the idea is now that I want to create subfolders in there and each one of those subfolders corresponds

01:12.530 --> 01:14.030
to a different project.

01:14.150 --> 01:20.660
So the way we do that is we can click this icon right here, that's the new folder icon, and I just

01:20.660 --> 01:22.640
clicked it and I'm going to type Project one.

01:22.640 --> 01:27.560
That's the name of that folder, which is also going to be the name of my first project.

01:27.560 --> 01:35.120
And then within that I want to select this icon right here, new file and that's going to be Main CP,

01:35.870 --> 01:38.720
that is going to be my C++ program.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.520
That's what we're going to build and run.

01:40.520 --> 01:43.400
So this font is a little bit small because I just installed this.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.350
Let me just increase it a little bit.

01:45.350 --> 01:47.540
And the way I did that was just command plus.

01:48.320 --> 01:53.720
All right, so let's write a really, really simple C++ program here and then we'll configure those

01:53.720 --> 01:55.940
extensions so that they can build and run it.

01:55.940 --> 02:03.380
So let's start with something LB Include IO stream that allows us to do input and output.

02:03.860 --> 02:09.320
We're going to say using namespace standard and now we're going to create the main function.

02:09.890 --> 02:14.540
If, if this looks foreign to you and you've just started the course, don't worry, that's perfectly

02:14.540 --> 02:15.080
normal.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.640
Just follow along, type along.

02:16.640 --> 02:20.540
The whole point of these lectures is to make sure we've got the environment set up correctly.

02:20.540 --> 02:24.320
All the syntax and everything you're seeing is going to be explained in the course.

02:24.320 --> 02:32.120
So at this point, what we're going to say is going to say, see out hello from Project one and we'll

02:32.120 --> 02:38.420
put an end line at the end to give us a new line and we return zero from Main to indicate that everything's

02:38.420 --> 02:38.810
good.

02:38.810 --> 02:40.940
And I just saved that with command desk's.

02:41.510 --> 02:44.000
First thing we're going to do is we're going to set up IntelliSense.

02:44.000 --> 02:50.150
IntelliSense is a little program that runs alongside Visual Studio code that watches what we're typing,

02:50.150 --> 02:54.710
and it tries to give us suggestions and it shows us when we have errors and it's very, very handy.

02:54.710 --> 02:56.030
So let's set that up.

02:56.030 --> 03:00.470
And the way we do that, we come up to view and then command palette.

03:00.470 --> 03:02.960
We can also use shift command p.

03:03.710 --> 03:05.980
And that's going to give us a bunch of options here.

03:05.990 --> 03:12.440
And if you just type C plus plus at the top, what we're looking for is this guy right here, C, C++,

03:12.440 --> 03:14.510
edit configurations UI.

03:14.540 --> 03:16.790
We need to make a couple of changes to that.

03:16.790 --> 03:21.980
So I'm going to open that up and I'm going to come right down here to where it says compiler path.

03:21.980 --> 03:26.990
And if I bring that back a little bit so I can see this little arrow down here, I want to change that

03:26.990 --> 03:28.430
to G plus plus.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.620
So I want to choose G plus plus right there.

03:32.070 --> 03:34.230
That's the compiler that's going to be used.

03:34.470 --> 03:38.970
And then I'm going to scroll down just a little bit more until I get to the C++ standard.

03:39.090 --> 03:42.840
And there I want to select C++ 17.

03:43.440 --> 03:43.890
That's it.

03:43.890 --> 03:44.700
That's all we need to do.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.960
And if you save this and I'm saving right now with commands.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.270
Now notice what's happened here over on the left hand side.

03:52.450 --> 03:55.930
A folder was automatically created called VS Code.

03:56.140 --> 04:00.310
And inside that folder there's a file called CP Properties JSON.

04:00.700 --> 04:04.590
That file contains the configuration information for what we just did.

04:04.600 --> 04:11.230
So now what we need to do is we need to set up a build task that will execute and build our program.

04:11.230 --> 04:16.410
And the first thing we have to do in order to do it, we have to select that main CP file.

04:16.420 --> 04:17.860
This is very important.

04:17.860 --> 04:24.070
Every time that we need to build something in Visual Studio code, we need to select that main file

04:24.070 --> 04:25.210
that we're trying to build.

04:25.600 --> 04:32.800
So we need to define that build task so we can come up to terminal and select configure default, build

04:32.800 --> 04:34.690
task, and I'll select that.

04:34.690 --> 04:37.720
And then it's going to ask us what build system are you using?

04:37.720 --> 04:39.190
What compiler are we using?

04:39.190 --> 04:41.200
Well, we're using G plus plus.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.340
You can see it right here.

04:42.340 --> 04:44.920
I'm going to select that now.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.090
It's created a new file.

04:46.090 --> 04:47.350
You can see it over here on the left.

04:47.350 --> 04:54.550
It's called Tasks JSON and it contains configuration information for how Visual Studio code is going

04:54.550 --> 04:55.870
to build our project.

04:56.260 --> 04:59.860
Now, we need to make a few changes to this file right here on line nine.

04:59.860 --> 05:01.180
You'll see this sorry.

05:01.180 --> 05:03.460
On line eight, you'll see this args section.

05:03.460 --> 05:06.970
These are the arguments that are sent to the compiler and we're going to add a couple.

05:06.970 --> 05:14.440
So right after line nine, right after the minus G option, we're going to put in dash wall with a capital

05:14.440 --> 05:20.410
W lowercase alpha that tells the compiler to generate all warnings.

05:20.710 --> 05:29.530
Then we're going to add one more standard equals C plus plus 17 and that's dash STD equals C plus plus

05:29.530 --> 05:30.310
17.

05:30.310 --> 05:33.550
That tells the compiler to use the C++ 17 standard.

05:34.060 --> 05:37.690
And there's one more thing we need to do is we're going to change this line 12 right here.

05:37.690 --> 05:41.770
We're going to change that file to this name, file name.

05:41.860 --> 05:45.850
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to copy that and I'm going to paste it right in here.

05:46.750 --> 05:53.800
And then right after that, curly that closed curly brace, I'm just going to do slash star CP that

05:53.800 --> 05:59.050
tells the compiler to compile all the C++ files into folder by default.

05:59.050 --> 06:01.570
Visual Studio code will only compile one file.

06:01.570 --> 06:04.780
We only have one there now, but we'll have more than one later in the course.

06:04.780 --> 06:07.000
So we want to be sure that we're compiling all of them.

06:07.630 --> 06:08.110
That's it.

06:08.110 --> 06:10.360
Those are the changes we need to make at this point.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.260
We can save.

06:11.260 --> 06:14.770
I just saved with command s and we can close this down.

06:14.860 --> 06:16.840
Now we're ready to build our program.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.790
So remember what I told you.

06:18.820 --> 06:23.610
First thing you need to do is select the main CP file that you want to build.

06:23.650 --> 06:27.790
There may be and there will be many, many projects in here.

06:27.790 --> 06:31.960
We'll have project one, Project two, each one of them will have its own main CP.

06:31.960 --> 06:35.710
So we have to be sure that we select the one that we want to build, and then we're going to come up

06:35.710 --> 06:38.710
to terminal and run build task.

06:38.710 --> 06:45.400
You can also do shift command B when we do that, the compiler will build the executable file that we

06:45.400 --> 06:46.090
want to run.

06:46.090 --> 06:47.500
So I'm going to click that now.

06:48.430 --> 06:50.110
And you can see the output right here.

06:50.140 --> 06:52.560
Notice we're using the G plus plus compiler.

06:52.570 --> 06:56.710
There's that minus G minus wall minus standard C plus plus 17.

06:56.710 --> 07:04.480
We entered there's the star CP we entered and it's building main in project one folder.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.530
That's exactly what we want builds finished successfully.

07:07.540 --> 07:14.620
So if you notice a file was created over here, right there, that main file, that is our executable

07:14.650 --> 07:15.010
file.

07:15.010 --> 07:16.240
That's the file we can run.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.630
That's the file that's going to say hello from Project one when we execute it.

07:19.630 --> 07:20.600
How do you execute it?

07:20.620 --> 07:21.280
Real simple.

07:21.280 --> 07:25.720
I'm just going to close this here to give me a little bit more room and I am going to right click on

07:25.720 --> 07:29.470
that and then say Open an integrated terminal.

07:30.740 --> 07:32.990
And it's just opened that folder for me.

07:32.990 --> 07:36.770
And if I type LLS, it'll give me a listing of the files in that folder.

07:36.770 --> 07:42.290
And you can see you can see Main, you can see Main CP and you also see this main symbol file.

07:42.290 --> 07:44.450
That's something that the compiler generates.

07:44.450 --> 07:47.630
So if we want to run this program, we need to run main.

07:47.630 --> 07:50.630
We do a dot slash main.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.460
That dot slash is really important.

07:52.820 --> 07:56.330
So always use dot forward slash and then the name of the executable.

07:56.330 --> 07:59.300
And when I press enter, we should see hello from Project one.

07:59.600 --> 08:00.440
And there it is.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.090
That's exactly what we expected.

08:02.570 --> 08:03.230
Pretty cool.

08:03.230 --> 08:03.980
Pretty easy.

08:03.980 --> 08:08.390
Now, suppose I want to create another project right under here.

08:08.390 --> 08:13.520
If I click on that folder icon right there to create a new folder, it won't do what I want.

08:13.520 --> 08:16.940
What it'll do is it'll create that new folder underneath Project one.

08:16.940 --> 08:18.230
That's not what I want.

08:18.260 --> 08:21.620
I want Project two to be at the same level as Project one.

08:21.980 --> 08:24.380
Intuition says, Come on up here and click it, right?

08:24.380 --> 08:25.850
But that doesn't really work.

08:25.970 --> 08:27.410
So it's not too intuitive.

08:27.410 --> 08:31.550
But the way that you do it is you can select Project one and then just hit escape.

08:31.850 --> 08:35.090
So you see, I just press the escape key and I got this blue box.

08:35.360 --> 08:41.420
Now I can click on that folder and create a new project called Project two, and it's going to be at

08:41.420 --> 08:43.250
the same level as Project one.

08:43.250 --> 08:46.220
Now I can create my main CP file in here.

08:47.420 --> 08:49.870
And I can write another program and I'm actually not going to write it.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.520
I'm just going to copy this program since it's almost the same.

08:52.640 --> 08:59.630
So I'm just going to copy this program from here right into here, and we'll just make one change.

08:59.630 --> 09:00.920
We'll say project two.

09:02.090 --> 09:03.080
That's pretty easy.

09:03.110 --> 09:06.650
Now, if we run this, remember we have to build it first.

09:06.650 --> 09:10.550
We have to select which one we want to build, what we want to build project to.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.100
So make sure you select the main in project two.

09:13.130 --> 09:15.200
We don't want to select the main and Project one.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.370
We've already done that one.

09:16.670 --> 09:19.670
So I'm going to select that and then I'm going to build.

09:19.670 --> 09:25.640
So I'm going to go to terminal and select run the build task and we're done.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.500
You can see Build finished successfully.

09:27.500 --> 09:32.030
Project Two's main was created and there it is right here.

09:32.030 --> 09:35.900
So if I want to execute that, I can just open in the integrated terminal.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.450
We can do ls again if we want.

09:38.450 --> 09:39.170
There it is.

09:39.170 --> 09:43.400
And we do dot slash main and it's going to say hello from Project two.

09:43.670 --> 09:44.600
Pretty easy.

09:44.690 --> 09:47.930
We can modify this program slightly to get input from the user.

09:47.930 --> 09:48.770
Let's do that.

09:48.770 --> 09:55.340
Let's say we have an integer and we'll call that integer favorite number just like that.

09:55.430 --> 09:56.300
And then we'll keep this.

09:56.300 --> 09:57.500
Hello from Project two in there.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.960
But let's also ask the user to enter their favorite number.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.900
So we're going to say enter your favorite number.

10:03.710 --> 10:07.880
Then we're going to read that number into the favorite number variable.

10:07.880 --> 10:11.990
And now we're going to display and now we're going to display.

10:12.170 --> 10:14.630
Your favorite number is the number that just enter

10:18.080 --> 10:19.880
and we'll add a new line at the end.

10:20.450 --> 10:20.960
That's it.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.330
So we've just modified that program slightly.

10:23.330 --> 10:29.270
If we execute Main now, the old program is going to run because we haven't built the new one yet.

10:29.780 --> 10:30.000
Right.

10:30.050 --> 10:33.020
These updates are not in this main executable yet.

10:33.020 --> 10:34.280
That's why we need to build it.

10:34.280 --> 10:39.320
So we're going to select our main CPP and I'm going to select Terminal.

10:40.220 --> 10:41.510
Run the bill task.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.290
We have a successful build.

10:43.310 --> 10:48.410
Now I can come over here to my main right, click on it, open it in the terminal, and we could just

10:48.410 --> 10:49.010
run it.

10:50.690 --> 10:51.970
Hello from project two.

10:51.980 --> 10:53.080
Now it's asking me entry.

10:53.090 --> 10:53.870
My favorite number.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.940
Well, my favorite number let's say is 34.

10:56.120 --> 10:57.050
I'll hit enter.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.330
It says your favorite number is 34.

11:00.050 --> 11:03.770
Simple as that we can create as many projects as we like.

11:03.770 --> 11:10.580
Once our tasks, JSON and our CP properties JSON files are configured, then we can create as many as

11:10.580 --> 11:10.880
we want.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.620
We don't have to touch those again.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.990
They'll apply to all the subprojects.

11:15.170 --> 11:20.960
So in the next video, I'll show you how to use the debugger and how to configure the debugger so that

11:20.960 --> 11:26.660
we can walk through our code one line at a time and inspect our variables and their values as we execute

11:26.660 --> 11:27.320
the code.

11:27.320 --> 11:31.460
It's a very, very handy tool that we can use to help us program.

11:31.550 --> 11:32.870
I'll see you in the next video.
