00:05.170 --> 00:05.770
Hello, everyone.

00:05.800 --> 00:11.290
So in this video, what we'll do is we'll download and install Visual Studio code on Mac and then we'll

00:11.290 --> 00:15.010
install a couple of extensions as well to get it going.

00:15.010 --> 00:22.900
So I open up your favorite browser and go to code Visual Studio, or you could just type Visual Studio

00:22.900 --> 00:26.260
code and in Google and Press Enter and it'll take you there.

00:26.260 --> 00:28.630
So you're going to get to a page, something like this.

00:28.660 --> 00:30.040
This is a microsoft product.

00:30.040 --> 00:35.380
So we're here on this website and what you want to do is you can click right here and download the Mac

00:35.410 --> 00:36.670
Universal build.

00:36.910 --> 00:37.990
I'd rather not do that.

00:37.990 --> 00:41.320
I'd rather download the specific build for my Mac.

00:41.410 --> 00:49.360
As many of you know, Mac now comes in the Apple, Silicon and Intel version, so may as well grab the

00:49.360 --> 00:49.960
one you need.

00:49.960 --> 00:53.050
And Visual Studio code supports both, which is really nice.

00:53.050 --> 00:59.260
So right now I'm on an Apple silicon iMac, so I'm just going to select download over here on the right.

01:00.490 --> 01:02.830
And you can see here where the max stuff is.

01:02.830 --> 01:08.880
You can download the universal build, which will run on both the Intel build or the Apple silicon build.

01:08.890 --> 01:11.080
So you know what you've got if you've got a mac.

01:11.110 --> 01:15.550
Like I said, I've got the Apple silicon right now, so I'm just going to click on here and we'll get

01:15.550 --> 01:16.780
the download coming.

01:17.260 --> 01:19.980
And I'm just going to open it with the archive utility.

01:19.990 --> 01:22.080
You can save it and then open it there as well.

01:22.090 --> 01:26.200
So I'm just going to click okay and give it a minute to download.

01:28.450 --> 01:31.330
And once it's downloaded, it should open up.

01:33.490 --> 01:37.570
There's the archive utility and it opened up in my other window.

01:37.570 --> 01:41.340
So let me drag that over here and that over from my other monitor.

01:41.350 --> 01:44.290
And you can see it's downloaded and extracted it.

01:44.300 --> 01:49.240
So all you want to do now is just want to click on Visual Studio code here and drag it over to your

01:49.240 --> 01:50.860
applications, just like the.

01:51.980 --> 01:52.580
That's it.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.290
Now, what we want to do is we want to run it.

01:54.290 --> 01:58.310
So I'm just going to click on applications and scroll down until you find it.

01:58.310 --> 02:01.040
And it is right there.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.460
So I'm just going to run that.

02:05.030 --> 02:10.040
Of course, first time you run it on Mac, depending on your security settings and your privacy settings,

02:10.040 --> 02:14.540
you may get a message like this or you may not even let you run it and you'll have to go and let it

02:14.540 --> 02:14.780
run.

02:14.780 --> 02:17.300
But again, if you're a mac user, you know what to do.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.250
I'm just going to select Open.

02:20.780 --> 02:24.530
And Visual Studio code opened up and enlarge this a little bit.

02:25.590 --> 02:28.510
And we've got this big old screen here with nothing going on.

02:28.530 --> 02:31.500
We've got some options over here on the left side.

02:31.740 --> 02:35.130
And I'm just going to close this little guy up right here.

02:35.130 --> 02:39.900
So this font is pretty small, so I'm just going to press command plus to make everything a little bit

02:39.900 --> 02:44.370
bigger for you guys and you can come through here and see what's going on.

02:44.370 --> 02:45.300
You can pick a theme.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.280
I'm just going to stick with this dark theme.

02:47.670 --> 02:49.520
There's a lot of themes that you can choose.

02:49.530 --> 02:54.570
It talks about coding in different programming languages, switching from other editors and so forth.

02:54.570 --> 02:55.740
I'm not going to do any of that.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.240
I'm just going to keep it default.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.670
So I'm just going to close this little window up right here.

03:00.300 --> 03:05.490
What we have to do is we have to tell Visual Studio code that we're going to do C++.

03:05.490 --> 03:11.610
And the way we do that is we add an extension and this bottom icon right here is the extensions.

03:11.610 --> 03:13.860
And what I want to do is I want to select that.

03:15.020 --> 03:19.760
And you can see that I've got nothing installed right now obviously because I just installed VS code,

03:19.760 --> 03:22.990
so there are no default extensions installed.

03:23.000 --> 03:29.810
But what I want to do is install the C++ extension right here where it says popular ones, it's right

03:29.810 --> 03:30.080
there.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.340
That's one of the real popular ones.

03:31.340 --> 03:37.910
If it doesn't show up here for you, you could just type C++ up here and press enter and it will find

03:37.910 --> 03:38.060
it.

03:38.060 --> 03:39.770
And it's this guy right here.

03:39.830 --> 03:44.930
If you just select it and this is what it's supposed to look like, you have this purple circle here

03:44.930 --> 03:45.690
with CC plus.

03:45.710 --> 03:47.600
Plus, it says Microsoft.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.790
It's got over 20 million downloads.

03:50.180 --> 03:55.100
I don't know how many downloads it's going to have when you guys watch this video, which may be a long

03:55.100 --> 03:55.700
time from now.

03:55.700 --> 03:59.330
Maybe so that's what this is the one we want to install.

03:59.330 --> 04:05.300
And in order to install it, all we need to do is just click install right here and it says installing

04:05.300 --> 04:07.340
and it's doing it down here.

04:07.340 --> 04:08.690
Just let it do its thing.

04:11.400 --> 04:18.300
And once it's finished, we are done installing that extension so we can erase that.

04:19.270 --> 04:22.570
And the next one we want to do is we want to type code.

04:22.600 --> 04:23.710
LL be.

04:24.800 --> 04:25.630
Now LDP.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.270
Sorry.

04:26.540 --> 04:29.330
And this is the one that we want to install next.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.570
These are the only two extensions that we're going to install.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.170
There are a lot of other ones out there.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.080
You've got CMA Code Runner.

04:36.170 --> 04:40.470
There's a whole bunch of them that just make things a lot more complicated than they need to be.

04:40.490 --> 04:46.910
So this is the one that allows us to run the ADB debugger, which is the debugger that we're going to

04:46.910 --> 04:48.110
be using in this class.

04:48.110 --> 04:50.410
And I'll let you run that in Visual Studio code.

04:50.420 --> 04:54.940
And it works really well, and it also supports Apple Silicon, which is pretty cool.

04:54.950 --> 04:59.710
So if you've got your Intel version or the Apple Silicon version, that will work.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.400
So I'm just going to select it.

05:01.760 --> 05:09.890
And you can see if you look at the Changelog, you can see that right there where it says new on version

05:09.890 --> 05:12.110
162 added support for Apple silicon.

05:12.110 --> 05:13.090
So that's pretty cool.

05:13.100 --> 05:16.730
So if again, if you've got Intel or Apple silicon, this will work just fine.

05:16.730 --> 05:18.950
So I'm going to select install here as well.

05:20.930 --> 05:22.140
And just let it do its thing.

05:22.160 --> 05:22.760
Be patient.

05:22.760 --> 05:23.870
Don't interrupt it.

05:24.630 --> 05:25.440
And that's it.

05:25.690 --> 05:30.820
I'm going to close this up and I'm going to go back to my explorer right here.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.060
What we're going to do now is we're going to open up a folder.

05:33.060 --> 05:40.470
We're going to set up a little folder structure, and then we're going to configure C++ in Visual Studio

05:40.470 --> 05:42.870
code so that we can build and run programs.

05:42.870 --> 05:44.490
So I'll see you all in the next video.
