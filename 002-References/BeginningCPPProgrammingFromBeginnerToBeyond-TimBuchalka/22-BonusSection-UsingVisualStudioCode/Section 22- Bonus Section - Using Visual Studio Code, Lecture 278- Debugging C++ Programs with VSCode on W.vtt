00:04.900 --> 00:10.450
In this video, I'll show you how to set up and use the Integrated Debugger in Visual Studio code.

00:10.450 --> 00:15.370
So for this example, I'm going to use Project two and I'm just going to make one little change right

00:15.370 --> 00:15.520
here.

00:15.520 --> 00:20.860
I'm going to initialize that number to 100 just so we can see it in the debugger in a minute.

00:21.130 --> 00:23.260
So let's create this.

00:23.260 --> 00:27.490
What we're going to do is we're going to create a launch JSON configuration file.

00:27.850 --> 00:31.870
First order of business is click on one of the main CP files.

00:31.870 --> 00:34.720
Since I'm using Project two, that's the one I'm going to select.

00:34.720 --> 00:40.690
So you can click on that file and then you're going to come up to run add configuration.

00:42.290 --> 00:45.050
And it's going to ask you again, what's your environment?

00:45.080 --> 00:50.900
We're going to always be using C++, GDB, WL, DB, so that's what I'm going to select.

00:51.680 --> 00:56.270
And again, I'm using GW 64 G plus plus.

00:56.270 --> 00:57.890
I'm going to select this guy right here.

01:01.730 --> 01:03.490
And we're going to come over here.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.250
Don't worry about this.

01:04.250 --> 01:08.150
You can just click that little red square right here and get out of here.

01:08.720 --> 01:13.130
The important thing is and we can come back over here as well to explore, just to clean this up a little

01:13.130 --> 01:13.570
bit.

01:13.580 --> 01:19.490
So the important thing is it has created a launch JSON file for us, and this is the one that's right

01:19.490 --> 01:22.490
here in the editor and this is the one that we're going to configure.

01:22.490 --> 01:25.040
And the configuration here is pretty easy.

01:25.940 --> 01:30.400
There's just one entry we need to change this one here in line 14, which is CW.

01:30.680 --> 01:32.600
That's our current working directory.

01:32.630 --> 01:40.130
What we're going to do is we're going to replace this with file name, and this time we're going to

01:40.130 --> 01:42.590
grab the dollar sign of the curlies as well.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.230
So we're going to put that right in there like that.

01:45.440 --> 01:45.980
That's it.

01:45.980 --> 01:46.900
So we're done with that.

01:46.910 --> 01:49.280
We can close up our launch JSON.

01:49.760 --> 01:52.880
Now what we're going to do is we want to debug this program.

01:52.880 --> 01:56.870
So in order to debug the program, we need some breakpoints.

01:56.870 --> 02:02.930
We need to tell the C++ debugger where to stop because otherwise it's just going to run the program.

02:02.930 --> 02:08.150
So it's got to stop so that we can examine variables, we can look at our logic, and we can step through

02:08.150 --> 02:14.600
the code one line at a time so that we can follow our logic and find mistakes or verify that what we

02:14.600 --> 02:15.530
did was correct.

02:15.530 --> 02:17.000
So let's do that.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.920
We can do this a couple of different ways.

02:18.920 --> 02:25.190
First of all, make sure that we've got this selected main step in whatever project we want to debug.

02:25.220 --> 02:30.680
In this case, we're debugging project two, so make sure your default is selected main DHCP.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.450
Then we can come up here to run.

02:32.450 --> 02:33.830
Start debugging.

02:35.030 --> 02:41.660
Or we can come over here on the left side here again, select main app and click that bug right there.

02:41.900 --> 02:42.830
Run and debug.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.030
That's what I'm going to do.

02:44.740 --> 02:48.070
And now what we need to do is we need to add a breakpoint to our code.

02:48.070 --> 02:52.810
And you can see over here in the gutter here, I'm sliding through and you can see that red dot coming

02:52.810 --> 02:53.040
around.

02:53.050 --> 02:53.950
That's a breakpoint.

02:53.950 --> 02:58.210
So if I want to put the breakpoint right about there, it'll light up.

02:58.210 --> 03:02.080
It'll also show up down here that says we've got a breakpoint.

03:02.560 --> 03:08.800
Visual Studio code has a little glitch sometimes where it captures breakpoints from a lot of the projects.

03:09.130 --> 03:10.450
Just the one you're working with.

03:10.450 --> 03:16.210
And an easy way to deal with that is just to before you start debugging, just come over here and click

03:16.210 --> 03:17.290
that X right there.

03:17.290 --> 03:21.460
That'll clear up all the breakpoints everywhere, and then you can just set the breakpoint where you

03:21.460 --> 03:21.880
want.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.980
So I'm going to set the breakpoint again right there.

03:24.460 --> 03:26.890
So now that we've done that, we're going to run the program.

03:26.890 --> 03:32.140
And what we can do is we can come up here and click on that little green arrow and you'll see what happens.

03:32.140 --> 03:34.240
The debugger comes into play.

03:34.330 --> 03:36.340
A lot of things seem to happen all at once.

03:36.340 --> 03:42.130
We've got this little menu bar right here, this bar of icons that allows us to step through our code

03:42.130 --> 03:46.360
one line at a time, stop the code, we run the code and so forth.

03:46.360 --> 03:51.910
We also have this variables window that popped up over here on the left, and this is showing the values

03:51.910 --> 03:53.050
of our local variables.

03:53.050 --> 03:53.920
Look at NUM.

03:53.920 --> 03:57.130
It's initialized to 100, so it shows up right over here.

03:58.060 --> 04:03.720
Also we can use our cursor and just hover over here and you can see its values 100.

04:03.730 --> 04:09.190
So it lets us inspect the value of that variable as we're running the code, which is really neat.

04:09.220 --> 04:13.420
So right here, this is the other line that shows you where I'm at in the program.

04:13.630 --> 04:17.590
So you can see that yellow bar shows us exactly where our program is.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.720
This line has not executed yet.

04:19.960 --> 04:24.370
So if we want to execute it, we can come over here and step over it or step into it.

04:24.370 --> 04:26.640
And we'll talk about all this in the course.

04:26.680 --> 04:31.180
And in this case, I want to step over it and notice the output came out down here.

04:31.180 --> 04:32.600
So that's the line we're at.

04:32.620 --> 04:36.430
So I'm going to step over it again and now we're going to get the input from the user.

04:36.430 --> 04:38.410
So let's say I type in 1200.

04:39.370 --> 04:44.620
Now, as soon as I press enter, that 1200 will be red into num, right?

04:44.620 --> 04:46.680
So my variables should change.

04:46.700 --> 04:51.840
I'm going to press enter and now notice that number up here is 1200 and I can also hover over.

04:51.910 --> 04:53.570
I'm over here and it's 100.

04:53.590 --> 04:56.850
So this is a really, really powerful feature debugger.

04:56.860 --> 04:58.510
The are are great.

04:58.510 --> 04:59.410
We use them all the time.

04:59.410 --> 05:00.340
We don't overuse them.

05:00.340 --> 05:05.110
If it's a really simple program and you've got simple logic and you can test your code easily, then

05:05.110 --> 05:07.270
there's real there's no real need to debug it.

05:07.270 --> 05:11.890
But sometimes it comes in really handy when we're trying to figure out a problem or looking at some

05:11.890 --> 05:15.550
really complex logic that we want to walk through step by step.

05:15.670 --> 05:16.640
So that's it.

05:16.660 --> 05:21.520
Now, if we want to stop the program, we could just click that little red box right here to stop.

05:22.270 --> 05:27.340
If we want to just continue full blast and skip all the breakpoints, we can click that little arrow

05:27.340 --> 05:28.000
right here.

05:28.720 --> 05:32.290
Or we could just click another few times until the program ends.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.920
And let me just stop it here so you can see what that looks like.

05:35.920 --> 05:36.760
So I stop it.

05:38.120 --> 05:38.290
Right.

05:38.330 --> 05:39.320
So now it's on notice.

05:39.320 --> 05:41.270
It's changed back to blue down here.

05:41.360 --> 05:43.220
And I can come back to my.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.420
Explorer and I can see everything that I'm doing.

05:46.420 --> 05:47.320
So there you go.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.090
That's how the debugger works.

05:49.090 --> 05:54.070
In the next video, what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how to use Visual Studio code with

05:54.070 --> 05:56.740
the source code that I've provided for the course.

05:56.740 --> 06:02.740
The source code that I provided for the course is in the format of code light projects, but that's

06:02.740 --> 06:03.040
okay.

06:03.070 --> 06:07.510
The work in Visual Studio code as well, and I'll show you exactly how to use them in the next video.
