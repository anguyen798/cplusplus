00:05.070 --> 00:06.000
Hello, everyone.

00:06.660 --> 00:11.190
In this video, we'll set up Visual Studio code to debug C++ programs.

00:11.550 --> 00:15.510
We've already set up IntelliSense and we've set up a build task.

00:15.510 --> 00:17.190
So now we're going to set up the debug.

00:17.220 --> 00:18.180
Where do we start?

00:18.270 --> 00:19.530
It's really quite simple.

00:19.530 --> 00:27.480
Select one of your C++ files, it doesn't matter which one, and then come up here to run and add configuration.

00:27.840 --> 00:35.250
Now you can be asked for your environment, select C++, GDB, LD, DB, and then the C++ compiler again,

00:35.250 --> 00:37.230
which in our case is G plus plus.

00:38.990 --> 00:42.390
Now you're going to have some stuff happen and things are going to be changing colors and so forth.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.550
Don't worry about any of that.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.970
What we're going to do now is modify this file that was just created called Launch JSON.

00:48.980 --> 00:50.840
We're going to make one minor change to it.

00:51.380 --> 00:53.290
You close this window up so we can see it.

00:53.300 --> 00:57.890
What we're going to do is we're going to change the entry for CW.

00:57.890 --> 01:03.600
DX It's on line 14 on my system here, and we're going to change this from workspace folder to file

01:03.620 --> 01:04.160
your name.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.690
So I'm just going to copy that.

01:06.790 --> 01:08.200
And paste it in here.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.620
And that's all we're going to do.

01:11.640 --> 01:15.930
Now, I'm going to save this and I'm going to close it since we don't need it any longer.

01:15.960 --> 01:18.210
All right, let's debug our first program.

01:18.420 --> 01:22.650
Let's modify Project Two's main CPP file just a little.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.950
So we have a little bit information to see in the debugger.

01:24.960 --> 01:30.600
So what I'm going to do here, I'm going to add an integer and let's just call this my favorite number

01:30.600 --> 01:34.320
and I'm going to initialize it to, let's say, 100 just so we have something to look at.

01:34.320 --> 01:38.700
So it's still going to display hello from Project two, but now we want to prompt the user to enter

01:38.700 --> 01:39.690
their favorite number.

01:39.690 --> 01:41.590
So we'll put another display statement in here.

01:41.620 --> 01:47.700
We'll just say Enter your favorite number and then we'll read in what type, and we're going to read

01:47.700 --> 01:49.380
that into favorite number.

01:49.590 --> 01:54.750
And then finally we're going to display your favorite number is and we'll display what they typed in

01:54.750 --> 01:55.710
right back at them.

01:55.830 --> 02:01.110
So we'll say your favorite number is and we'll display what they entered fave number, followed by a

02:01.110 --> 02:01.740
new line.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.040
All right, so that's it.

02:03.040 --> 02:07.230
So we made a small change, but an important change because we want to be able to see that favorite

02:07.230 --> 02:09.180
number change in the debugger.

02:09.270 --> 02:09.660
All right.

02:09.660 --> 02:13.530
So how do we debug now select the program you want to debug?

02:13.530 --> 02:16.890
Again, very important that we select that CP file that we want to debug.

02:16.890 --> 02:19.440
In this case, this is the one we want to debug.

02:19.470 --> 02:25.740
What we can do now is we can click that bug icon right there where it says run and debug and nothing

02:25.740 --> 02:26.910
will happen right away.

02:26.910 --> 02:30.030
But we need to do is we need to set a breakpoint in our code.

02:30.510 --> 02:34.980
This is where the debugger is going to stop when when it starts to debug our code.

02:34.980 --> 02:40.770
So I want it to stop right there, right on line five, so you can just move along here and just select

02:40.770 --> 02:45.090
the breakpoint, just click and it turns red and you can select as many breakpoints as you want.

02:45.750 --> 02:51.960
Notice now that the breakpoints show up here, there is a glitch in Visual Studio code where sometimes

02:51.960 --> 02:55.890
when you have multiple breakpoints across different projects, they all show here.

02:56.100 --> 03:01.260
And what I recommend you do is when just when you're about to start debugging, click on that X right

03:01.260 --> 03:03.780
there that erases all the breakpoints from everywhere.

03:03.780 --> 03:07.980
Now, you don't see any down here, and then you could just come up to your project and put the breakpoint

03:07.980 --> 03:09.210
exactly where you want it.

03:09.780 --> 03:14.580
So now that we've done that, we can click on this little green run icon right up here.

03:15.210 --> 03:17.730
And when I do that, the debugger will engage.

03:17.730 --> 03:22.020
You can see that there's a build happening and now this bottom bar turns orange.

03:22.020 --> 03:24.180
And now there's a couple of things that have just happened.

03:24.540 --> 03:30.270
Notice that this line five is highlighted and the play head is right there, right on line five.

03:30.270 --> 03:33.850
That tells you that the debugger stopped at line five just like you asked it to.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.220
That's where you put the breakpoint.

03:35.310 --> 03:37.530
So line five has not been executed.

03:37.530 --> 03:42.990
Line four has notice that line four is our declaration of favorite number.

03:43.380 --> 03:46.740
And if you look over here in your local variables, there you see its value.

03:46.740 --> 03:47.670
That's pretty cool.

03:47.970 --> 03:51.870
So you can see favorite number is 100 and you can also hover over favorite number.

03:52.330 --> 03:53.550
You'll see the 100 pop up.

03:53.550 --> 03:55.200
You can do that anywhere it occurs.

03:55.500 --> 03:59.790
Now, what we want to do is we want to execute one line at a time and we could do that with this button

03:59.790 --> 04:00.150
right here.

04:00.150 --> 04:04.380
You can see we've got a series of buttons here that allow us to interact with the debugger.

04:05.130 --> 04:10.260
This steps over the code, it steps into code and I discuss these in more detail throughout the course

04:10.500 --> 04:10.950
here.

04:10.950 --> 04:14.190
We can just stop the debugger and here we can just continue.

04:14.190 --> 04:16.890
So what I want to do is I want to execute one line at a time.

04:16.890 --> 04:22.740
So I'm going to select step over and you can see the play head now moves to line six and the line five

04:22.740 --> 04:26.460
executed and displayed something on the screen just like we expected.

04:27.060 --> 04:27.510
All right.

04:27.510 --> 04:30.360
And now it's going to ask me, what's your favorite number?

04:30.360 --> 04:33.480
So I'm just going to type in something other than 100 so you can see a change.

04:33.480 --> 04:39.990
This is type in 45 and I'll press enter and notice my local variable right here, 45.

04:39.990 --> 04:41.010
That's pretty neat.

04:41.220 --> 04:45.260
This allows me to step through my code and see what's happening.

04:45.270 --> 04:46.740
Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

04:46.740 --> 04:52.260
It's much easier to see it this way and then we can just continue running the program and we're done.

04:52.260 --> 04:52.770
So you see.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.780
Hello from project to enter your favorite number?

04:54.780 --> 04:57.090
I entered 45 and then it displayed.

04:57.090 --> 04:59.730
Your favorite number is 45, just as we expected.

04:59.850 --> 05:07.620
When you're done debugging, you can click over here, go back to explore and just debug or code whatever

05:07.620 --> 05:08.580
project you like.

05:09.180 --> 05:09.630
All right.

05:09.630 --> 05:11.700
So that shows you how to set up debugging.

05:11.700 --> 05:16.110
So at this point, we've got building, we've got running and we've got debugging all set up.

05:16.110 --> 05:21.120
In the next video, I'm going to show you how to use Visual Studio code with the source code that I

05:21.120 --> 05:22.380
provide for the course.
