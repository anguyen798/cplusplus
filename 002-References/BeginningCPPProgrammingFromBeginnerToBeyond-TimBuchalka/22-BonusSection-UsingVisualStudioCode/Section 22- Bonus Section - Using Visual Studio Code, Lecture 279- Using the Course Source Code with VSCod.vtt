00:04.820 --> 00:10.880
In this video, I'll show you how to use the source code provided for the course in Visual Studio code.

00:11.360 --> 00:16.250
So the first thing we need to do is we need to get the source code and the source code is in the course

00:16.250 --> 00:20.630
and you can see here in the course content and if you scroll all the way to the bottom, you'll see

00:20.630 --> 00:27.590
section 22, extra information source code and other stuff right here and right in there, you'll see

00:27.590 --> 00:29.010
source code for all sections.

00:29.010 --> 00:33.650
So if you click on that, you're going to see the source code that's going to be downloadable here,

00:33.860 --> 00:38.030
and each one of these is going to be a zip file for each section of the course.

00:38.030 --> 00:41.960
Now, as I'm making this video, this is in section 22.

00:41.960 --> 00:48.230
When you all watch this video, most likely this will be way down here, section 25 or 26 or 27 or somewhere

00:48.230 --> 00:54.230
down at the bottom of the content, because the new lectures that I'll put in the course will be inserted

00:54.230 --> 00:54.620
in here.

00:54.620 --> 00:59.450
So anyway, just look for extra information and then source code for all sections and you'll find it.

00:59.450 --> 01:02.660
And then once you do that, you can download the source code.

01:02.660 --> 01:09.140
So for example, I'm going to download section four right here and I'm just going to click on there

01:10.160 --> 01:12.200
and then I'm going to save that to my desktop.

01:12.200 --> 01:15.500
I've already done that and you can extract it to the desktop as well.

01:15.500 --> 01:19.940
So the idea is create a section for folder on my desktop.

01:19.940 --> 01:23.240
Now I say my desktop, you can do this anywhere you like.

01:23.600 --> 01:26.630
I'm just putting it on my desktop just to make it easier to show you.

01:26.630 --> 01:31.160
So I've already done that and if you come over here you can see my desktop.

01:31.190 --> 01:36.320
There is the section for folder that I unzipped and there are the contents of the folder.

01:36.350 --> 01:40.820
You'll notice this is a code like structure and that's okay, Visual Studio code, we'll just ignore

01:40.850 --> 01:41.180
that.

01:41.180 --> 01:47.060
But I've got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven projects inside this folder.

01:47.510 --> 01:49.190
So I think you know what to do.

01:49.220 --> 01:53.240
You go over to Visual Studio code and you open up the section for folder.

01:53.240 --> 01:54.950
So let's do that right now.

01:57.370 --> 02:04.570
So here's Visual Studio code and I'm just going to open the folder and I'm going to open up the section

02:04.570 --> 02:06.760
for folder on my desktop.

02:07.510 --> 02:13.450
So I'm just going to select that folder and it's going to open it up just like we did when we created

02:13.450 --> 02:13.600
our.

02:13.930 --> 02:17.110
Now again, you'll notice this code light information Makefile.

02:17.110 --> 02:20.680
You can delete this folder and you can delete these two files if you like.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.610
I wouldn't delete them.

02:21.610 --> 02:25.240
I would just leave them in there in case you ever want to use code like they're there, so you might

02:25.240 --> 02:26.080
as well keep them there.

02:26.590 --> 02:29.320
So we can't do anything yet.

02:29.320 --> 02:36.220
Remember, we need to create the V code folder with the launch json test, JSON and CP properties file.

02:36.370 --> 02:38.770
We only have to do that once per project.

02:38.770 --> 02:45.040
So once we include this section for folder, now we have to set that up and then after that we're good

02:45.040 --> 02:45.370
to go.

02:45.370 --> 02:50.530
We can compile and build any of these projects a couple of ways we can do this.

02:50.530 --> 02:53.590
We can do it the same way that we did it in the previous videos, right?

02:53.590 --> 02:55.390
I could just do it manually and create them.

02:55.390 --> 02:59.320
That's pretty easy and that's what I'm going to do now, just so that you can see it one more time,

02:59.620 --> 03:05.260
you can also just copy and paste that vs code folder that you've already created in that other project

03:05.260 --> 03:05.920
that we did.

03:05.990 --> 03:08.380
Just copy it right in here and it'll be good to go.

03:08.920 --> 03:09.190
All right.

03:09.190 --> 03:13.450
So what I'm going to do is, like I said, I'm going to create it from scratch, just like we did before.

03:13.450 --> 03:17.080
So I'm just going to open up any one of these guys and select that main.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.610
CP That's important.

03:19.060 --> 03:25.120
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to come up here to view the command palette and select again,

03:25.120 --> 03:27.040
that's edit configurations UI.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.460
If that doesn't show up, just type C++ and it will show up somewhere in here.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.690
That's what I'm going to choose.

03:32.140 --> 03:33.490
We'll do just like before.

03:33.490 --> 03:40.600
We'll change this GC to G Plus Plus and we'll come down here and we'll set the compiler standard to

03:40.600 --> 03:44.020
C++ 17 right there.

03:44.050 --> 03:44.650
That's it.

03:44.650 --> 03:45.730
I'm saving that.

03:46.120 --> 03:51.820
And now you can see that it's created the V code folder with that CP properties JSON file.

03:51.820 --> 03:52.570
Pretty good.

03:52.870 --> 03:53.890
So we're done with that.

03:53.890 --> 03:55.180
I'm just going to close this up.

03:55.180 --> 04:00.640
The next thing we'll do is we need to create the task JSON file, so we'll come over here to terminal

04:00.940 --> 04:03.310
and configure default build task.

04:03.790 --> 04:05.020
What are we using?

04:05.020 --> 04:11.140
We're using G plus plus right here and that's going to create my test JSON file.

04:11.140 --> 04:16.480
What I can do here is just like we did before, I want to add my warnings.

04:16.960 --> 04:20.530
I want to add the C++ 17 standard.

04:23.830 --> 04:31.360
I want to change line 12 here, which is the file to file your name just like that.

04:31.360 --> 04:36.730
And I just want to add slash slash star DHCP so it compiles all the files.

04:37.300 --> 04:37.990
That's it.

04:37.990 --> 04:39.130
We're done with that.

04:39.130 --> 04:42.100
So at this point we can build and run a project.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.350
So let's run this first program right here.

04:44.350 --> 04:51.040
So again, I can select close test JSON, I can select that main CP and I can come up with the terminal,

04:51.220 --> 04:54.850
run the build test and we should get a clean compile that we do.

04:54.850 --> 04:58.570
And you can see right here or my mouse is that it's doing first program.

04:58.570 --> 05:02.830
That's that project right there, that folder and it finished successfully.

05:02.830 --> 05:07.720
If I want to run the XY file which was created, you can see it's created right there.

05:08.050 --> 05:15.490
I can right click on that, open it in the integrated terminal and just type dot slash main XY.

05:16.030 --> 05:19.020
Enter your favorite number between one and 150.

05:19.780 --> 05:20.320
Amazing.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.730
That's my favorite number too.

05:21.900 --> 05:24.010
Just like what the source code says up here.

05:25.240 --> 05:26.560
So that's it.

05:26.560 --> 05:26.980
We're done.

05:26.980 --> 05:30.730
We can run any of the other programs in any of the other folders the same way.

05:31.450 --> 05:35.350
Now, what we're going to do is we're going to set up the debugger.

05:35.620 --> 05:38.830
So we're going to set up our debugger so that we can debug as well.

05:38.830 --> 05:46.000
So what we do now is we go up to run add configuration, we're going to select g plus plus gdb lib.

05:47.060 --> 05:53.930
We're going to slight G plus plus again and we're going to get this running when it's done, just kill

05:53.930 --> 05:57.430
it right here with that little red box because we're not interested in running it right now.

05:57.440 --> 06:03.110
What we do want to do is we want to modify this launch JSON file and all we're doing is we're taking

06:03.110 --> 06:09.380
this file, your name right here, including the dollar and the curlies, just like that.

06:09.380 --> 06:11.780
I'm copying it and I'm pasting it into here.

06:14.870 --> 06:15.830
Just like that.

06:18.020 --> 06:18.680
And that's it.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.820
We're done with that.

06:20.180 --> 06:26.390
If you make mistakes here, let's say you forget that that close quote, you're going to get squiggles

06:26.390 --> 06:27.350
and stuff will turn red.

06:27.350 --> 06:29.000
So make sure you don't see any of that.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.770
Everything looks nice and nice and clean like this.

06:31.790 --> 06:34.670
No squiggly lines, no red errors or anything like that.

06:34.970 --> 06:38.270
When we're done, we can save it and I can close that up.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.370
And now let's say I'm here.

06:40.370 --> 06:46.340
And so if I want to debug this program, I would select the main CP file and I would click on this bug

06:46.340 --> 06:47.030
right here.

06:47.840 --> 06:52.160
If you have any breakpoint set down here, you can just delete them all, as I showed you before.

06:52.160 --> 06:55.430
And now we're going to set a breakpoint, let's say, right there.

06:56.860 --> 07:01.270
And once we're good to go, we just press this green arrow right here and our program will start in

07:01.270 --> 07:02.080
the debugger.

07:02.410 --> 07:06.460
You can see I've got a variable favorite number here and you can see its value is zero.

07:06.460 --> 07:11.080
Its value is actually undefined because I haven't defined it, but the debugger is putting a zero in

07:11.110 --> 07:12.940
there that could be any value in there.

07:12.940 --> 07:13.560
That's it.

07:13.570 --> 07:17.830
Now if I want to execute line eight, which is where I'm stopped at, I would just click this button

07:17.830 --> 07:22.840
right here, step over, and now it's asked me, enter your favorite number and it's just waiting me

07:22.840 --> 07:23.650
to type something in.

07:23.650 --> 07:26.050
I'll type in 45 and press enter.

07:26.290 --> 07:27.760
Now I'm at the next line.

07:27.760 --> 07:32.290
You can see that now favorite number is 45 and I can continue here.

07:32.290 --> 07:34.540
I can stop the program, I could do whatever I like.

07:34.780 --> 07:35.650
That's it.

07:36.100 --> 07:36.820
Program is finished.

07:36.820 --> 07:41.440
I can go back to my explorer and execute another program here.

07:41.530 --> 07:42.700
So there you go.

07:42.700 --> 07:47.410
This is how you would use the provided source code with Visual Studio code.

07:47.410 --> 07:52.630
So at this point, you have everything you need to be able to work in code light or in Visual Studio

07:52.630 --> 07:53.290
code.

07:53.290 --> 07:58.180
Some students prefer code light, other students prefer Visual Studio code, and now you've got the

07:58.180 --> 07:59.710
tools to do it both ways.
