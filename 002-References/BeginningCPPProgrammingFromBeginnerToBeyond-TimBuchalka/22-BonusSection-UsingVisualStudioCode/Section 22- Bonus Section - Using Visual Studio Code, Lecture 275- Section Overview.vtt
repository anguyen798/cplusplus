Welcome to this bonus section for the course.

00:08.330 --> 00:13.910
In this section of the course, I'll go through the steps needed to use Microsoft Visual Studio code

00:13.910 --> 00:19.250
or VS Code for short with C++ and with the projects used in this course.

00:20.200 --> 00:24.490
Vsco has become a very popular ID over the past few years.

00:24.940 --> 00:28.740
It's a microsoft product that's free, built on open source.

00:28.750 --> 00:35.410
It's cross-platform and supports Windows Mac OS ten and Linux, and it's also cross language.

00:35.410 --> 00:41.230
It supports C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and many, many other programming languages.

00:41.620 --> 00:44.380
It's fast, it's small, and it's very powerful.

00:44.770 --> 00:49.450
It's also very extensible via extensions that we can install and customize.

00:50.220 --> 00:51.660
So is it easy to use?

00:51.690 --> 00:52.690
Yes and no.

00:52.710 --> 00:54.510
It's easy to use once you set it up.

00:54.870 --> 00:59.430
And that's the purpose of this section, to walk you through the setup for C plus.

00:59.430 --> 01:04.470
Plus, you'll see a lot of different ways to set up Visual Studio code out on the Internet.

01:04.890 --> 01:07.080
Some of them are okay, some of them are not okay.

01:07.080 --> 01:10.260
Some of them use a lot of extensions unnecessarily.

01:10.260 --> 01:16.770
I'm going to keep it as barebones as I can so that we can we can get up and running with C++ and VS

01:16.770 --> 01:17.880
code pretty quickly.

01:18.900 --> 01:23.590
So what we'll do in this section is we'll go through the procedure needed to install and configure VTS

01:23.610 --> 01:25.530
code so that it works with plus.

01:26.790 --> 01:32.610
Well then set up a folder structure so that we can organize our projects and let us easily work with

01:32.610 --> 01:33.990
multiple projects.

01:34.530 --> 01:41.460
Then I'll show you how to build, run and debug your own C++ programs as well as the projects provided

01:41.460 --> 01:43.290
with the source code for this course.

01:43.290 --> 01:45.060
All in Visual Studio code.

01:45.570 --> 01:50.090
Now this section contains videos for Windows Mac OS ten and Linux.

01:50.100 --> 01:55.800
You'll most likely just watch the videos that pertain to your specific operating system, but feel free

01:55.800 --> 01:57.090
to watch them all if you like.

01:57.990 --> 01:59.160
So let's get started.

01:59.190 --> 02:02.340
First up, let's get started with Microsoft Windows.
