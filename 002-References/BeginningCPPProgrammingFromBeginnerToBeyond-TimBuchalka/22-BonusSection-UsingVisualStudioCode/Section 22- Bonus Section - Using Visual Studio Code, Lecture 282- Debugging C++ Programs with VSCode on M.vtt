00:04.750 --> 00:05.600
Welcome back.

00:05.620 --> 00:11.890
In this video, I'm going to show you how to set up the debugger so that we can debug C++ programs in

00:11.890 --> 00:13.060
Visual Studio code.

00:13.360 --> 00:20.020
The debugger is a great tool that allows us to execute our code one line at a time, and we can inspect

00:20.020 --> 00:21.430
variables as we do them.

00:21.760 --> 00:27.100
So let's use the same project that we wrote in the previous video, and I'm going to debug Project two

00:27.130 --> 00:27.670
here.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.470
I'm just going to make one little change to it.

00:29.470 --> 00:34.960
I'm going to initialize favorite number to 100 just so we can see it and see it when it changes.

00:36.040 --> 00:37.360
All right, so where do we start?

00:37.390 --> 00:38.350
Well, it's pretty easy.

00:38.350 --> 00:41.710
You just select the file, any main CPP file.

00:41.740 --> 00:46.960
What we're doing now is we're configuring the debugger, so I'm going to select main CPP, then I'm

00:46.960 --> 00:50.440
going to go through run and add a configuration.

00:51.630 --> 00:54.210
And I'm going to select C plus plus gdb.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.520
And my G plus plus compiler again.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.680
Then you'll see some stuff happen and you'll see this little menu bar pop up.

01:01.690 --> 01:07.220
Just click that little red box to stop the debugger and we'll finish configuring it.

01:07.240 --> 01:09.880
I'm going to close this window down here to give us some more room.

01:09.880 --> 01:12.760
And you can see that a new file was created.

01:12.850 --> 01:14.950
It's called Launch JSON.

01:15.130 --> 01:18.940
And this is the one that we're going to modify slightly to get our debugger to work.

01:18.970 --> 01:24.370
The most important thing to do here is we want to change line nine, which is the type, and we want

01:24.370 --> 01:28.450
to change that from CP Dpkg to LSB.

01:28.480 --> 01:34.200
Now when we do that, you'll see that we have some errors pop up here on lines 13, 15, 16 and 17.

01:34.210 --> 01:36.580
We want to delete those lines completely.

01:37.570 --> 01:42.610
So let me get rid of that and we'll get rid of these three lines as well.

01:43.000 --> 01:47.110
And that's what we've got now on line 13 should be filed.

01:47.110 --> 01:47.650
Your name.

01:47.650 --> 01:51.960
If it's anything other than that, be sure to change it, to file your name and that's it.

01:51.970 --> 01:52.340
We're done.

01:52.420 --> 01:55.270
Make sure again, make sure there's no squiggles and no errors in here.

01:55.570 --> 01:56.710
I just saved that.

01:56.710 --> 01:58.900
And I'm going to close it because we're done with it.

01:58.900 --> 02:02.080
So now we're ready to debug to start the debugger.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.640
Select the file that you want to debug.

02:04.660 --> 02:08.080
So in this case, I want to debug main CPP in Project two.

02:08.440 --> 02:12.970
If I wanted to debug Project one, I would click on main CPP and Project one.

02:12.970 --> 02:16.330
So I don't I want Project Two's main CPP.

02:16.330 --> 02:19.000
So I've just selected it and here it is in my editor.

02:19.240 --> 02:23.500
To start the debugger, you click on this bug icon right here, run and debug.

02:23.500 --> 02:27.090
So I'll do that now and you'll notice a couple of things happen.

02:27.100 --> 02:33.730
Well, one is you have this play arrow up here and you have this information area where you have variables

02:33.730 --> 02:36.190
and watches and call stacks and breakpoints.

02:36.370 --> 02:37.960
I'll cover these during the course.

02:38.380 --> 02:42.780
I'll cover them in code light in the course, but it's the same concept in Visual Studio code.

02:42.790 --> 02:45.100
What we need to do first is set a breakpoint.

02:45.100 --> 02:49.750
This is the place where the bugger is going to stop executing our code.

02:49.930 --> 02:52.240
You can do that right over here on the left side.

02:52.240 --> 02:56.710
If you just hover over this left gutter here, you see that red dot that keeps popping up?

02:56.890 --> 02:58.480
Well, you could just select that.

02:58.480 --> 03:02.350
So let's say that I wanted to stop right on that line.

03:02.350 --> 03:07.120
So now when the debugger starts executing, it's going to run the program and stop here and then we

03:07.120 --> 03:08.620
can control it from there.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.490
Also, notice that when to select that breakpoint, it shows up down here.

03:13.310 --> 03:15.920
Bright main KPIs breakpoint in Project two.

03:15.920 --> 03:21.500
Now Visual Studio code has a glitch where sometimes all the breakpoints and all the projects show up

03:21.500 --> 03:21.990
here.

03:22.010 --> 03:26.870
My recommendation is when you start your debugging, as soon as you click on that bug icon, just come

03:26.870 --> 03:32.240
down here and click that X if there's anything there that clears out all the breakpoints everywhere,

03:32.240 --> 03:36.110
and then you can just come back up and click select your breakpoint and you're good to go.

03:36.110 --> 03:40.940
So once you're ready to start debugging, we click on that green play button right up here on the top

03:40.940 --> 03:41.540
left.

03:42.230 --> 03:47.330
And when I do that, you see this little menu option here comes up with these icons that control the

03:47.330 --> 03:48.020
debugger.

03:48.020 --> 03:53.600
The bottom bar down here turns orange, and this area right here is where your variables show up.

03:53.600 --> 03:58.760
You can see my favorite number of variables, 100, and that's exactly what I initialized it to.

03:58.790 --> 04:04.070
We can also hover over our variable names just like that, and you can see the 100 pop up.

04:04.070 --> 04:06.740
That's the value and that's the current value.

04:06.740 --> 04:09.350
If we change it, that number is going to change.

04:09.500 --> 04:14.000
What I can do next is and you can see that line six executed right down here in the terminal.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.230
Hello from project two.

04:15.530 --> 04:20.060
So now what I can do is I can click these buttons and I'll explain these buttons during the course.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.100
But this one right here just steps over the code.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.630
It executes that statement.

04:23.630 --> 04:29.480
So if I want to execute that statement now, the program is basically waiting for us to type something

04:29.480 --> 04:29.630
in.

04:29.630 --> 04:30.200
Right, right here.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.790
We have to enter our favorite number.

04:31.790 --> 04:36.380
So I'm going to enter in something other than 100 so that we can see favorite number change.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.110
Let me type in 45 and press enter.

04:39.590 --> 04:42.650
You can see now that the play head is here on line nine.

04:42.650 --> 04:47.510
Line nine has not executed yet, but also notice I entered 45.

04:47.510 --> 04:52.550
But look what happened over here on the top left and my variables favorite number is now 45.

04:52.550 --> 04:56.180
And again, I can hover over it anywhere that it's being used to see its value.

04:56.180 --> 04:57.280
This is really handy.

04:57.290 --> 05:02.780
Sometimes programming gets really complex and it's very helpful to be able to execute your code one

05:02.780 --> 05:07.430
line at a time and see your variables, see the results of your calculations visually.

05:07.430 --> 05:10.490
And it can be very, very useful when we're done.

05:10.490 --> 05:16.070
We can just continue the program or we can stop the program right here in this case, I'm just going

05:16.070 --> 05:20.540
to continue and you can see it says here, your favorite number is 45.

05:20.540 --> 05:21.920
And at this point, we're done.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.930
This bottom bar turns blue again.

05:23.930 --> 05:29.540
And if we want to continue editing and so forth, we can just click explore and go right back to our

05:29.540 --> 05:30.290
files.

05:30.440 --> 05:31.490
So that's it.

05:31.610 --> 05:35.750
At this point, we've set up Visual Studio code for building a task.

05:35.750 --> 05:40.190
We know how to execute our executable and we know how to debug our project.

05:40.190 --> 05:45.470
In the next video, I'll show you how we can use the source code that I provide for the course within

05:45.470 --> 05:46.520
Visual Studio code.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.300
I'll see you there.
