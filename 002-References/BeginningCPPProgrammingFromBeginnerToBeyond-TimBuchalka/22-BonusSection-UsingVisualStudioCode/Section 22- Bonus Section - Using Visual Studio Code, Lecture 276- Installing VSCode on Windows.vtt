Hello, everyone.

00:06.430 --> 00:12.670
In this video we're going to download and install Visual Studio code on Windows and we're also going

00:12.670 --> 00:15.700
to set up the C++ extension for it.

00:16.210 --> 00:24.970
Now, before you execute anything in this video, please be sure that the GW 64 C++ compiler has already

00:24.970 --> 00:27.310
been installed and configured on your system.

00:27.310 --> 00:31.660
That's very important that that's done already before we install Visual Studio code.

00:32.080 --> 00:37.630
If you haven't done that, please go to section two and refer to the instructions for installing Min

00:37.690 --> 00:41.800
GW 64, the C++ compiler on Windows.

00:42.850 --> 00:45.190
So moving forward, I'm assuming that that's done.

00:45.400 --> 00:50.740
What we want to do is open up your favorite browser and head over to code Visual Studio.

00:51.700 --> 00:55.480
You can also search for Visual Studio code in Google and it'll take you there.

00:55.990 --> 01:00.370
You're going to get a page that looks similar to this and you can see that this is big blue button right

01:00.370 --> 01:02.830
here looking right out and saying download for Windows.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.380
So it's already detected that I'm running Windows.

01:05.380 --> 01:09.610
And there's also a download button over here that gives you some more options in case you've got a 32

01:09.610 --> 01:11.110
bit version of Windows.

01:11.110 --> 01:15.310
So I've got a regular 64 bit version of Windows, which is what most people have.

01:15.400 --> 01:20.080
And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to click this button, download for Windows and that will

01:20.080 --> 01:21.280
start my download.

01:21.550 --> 01:26.170
It'll take you to this getting started page and you can see here that the file is going to be saved

01:26.170 --> 01:31.900
when I click Save File and once that installer is saved, that's what I want to execute.

01:31.900 --> 01:36.700
So I'm going to come up here to my browser and grab that download, which is right here, and I'm just

01:36.700 --> 01:40.300
going to double click on it to install it.

01:41.050 --> 01:44.770
Now, once the install begins right here, I'm just going to get rid of this browser.

01:44.770 --> 01:48.040
I don't need it anymore and I really don't want it to clutter up my screen.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.510
So here's the license agreement.

01:49.510 --> 01:55.510
You can look through that and accept the agreement and then select next select the path you want to

01:55.510 --> 01:56.260
install it to.

01:56.260 --> 01:57.910
I'm just going to use the defaults.

01:58.570 --> 01:59.710
I'll select next.

02:00.880 --> 02:04.960
Next again, and now it says select additional tests.

02:04.990 --> 02:08.490
The only thing that I said on here is that last checkbox right here.

02:08.530 --> 02:09.700
Add to the path.

02:09.940 --> 02:15.160
If you want to create an icon on your desktop for Visual Studio code, then select this first option.

02:16.060 --> 02:19.030
I'll select next and then install.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.630
The install will progress pretty quickly.

02:22.630 --> 02:24.820
This is a fairly small application.

02:24.820 --> 02:26.890
It's a very fast application as well.

02:28.230 --> 02:32.670
So once it's finished, what we'll do is we'll launch Visual Studio code.

02:32.710 --> 02:34.070
That's what I'm going to do right now.

02:34.080 --> 02:38.160
You can see that that checkbox is checked and I'm going to select Finish.

02:39.170 --> 02:44.300
And that'll bring up Visual Studio code, and I'm just going to make this full screen.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.160
We can just get rid of some of these messages.

02:49.160 --> 02:53.120
And this is the screen that you're going to get the first time that you install Visual Studio code.

02:53.150 --> 02:57.260
It's just a getting started screen and it's kind of small.

02:57.290 --> 02:59.060
So I'm just going to enlarge this font.

02:59.060 --> 02:59.960
I'm just going to hit control.

02:59.960 --> 03:04.310
Plus, just to make it a little bit nicer on video so you can see it a little bit better.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.800
So this just gives you some information.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.710
You want to pick a theme and I'll just pick this same dark theme.

03:10.760 --> 03:13.730
You can look at the different languages that it supports and so forth.

03:13.730 --> 03:15.450
So there's a lot of information in here.

03:15.470 --> 03:16.790
I'm going to close that.

03:17.750 --> 03:21.500
And now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to this icon right over here at the left, down at the

03:21.500 --> 03:23.420
bottom extensions.

03:23.420 --> 03:24.740
And I'm going to select that.

03:26.030 --> 03:32.040
And what I want to do is I want to install the C C++ extension and you can see it right here.

03:32.060 --> 03:37.940
Notice that I have zero extensions installed because I just installed Visual Studio code as a fresh

03:37.940 --> 03:38.630
install.

03:38.630 --> 03:41.600
So in this case, this is the extension that I want to install.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.920
It's here under popular.

03:43.160 --> 03:48.650
If that does not show up under here, you can always search for the extension up here, just type C++

03:48.800 --> 03:50.510
and you'll see it right there.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.580
So this is the one we want to select.

03:52.670 --> 03:57.020
You'll know it's the one because you've got this circle here with some purple, white and black and

03:57.020 --> 04:00.170
it says C slash, C++, Microsoft.

04:00.170 --> 04:03.620
And it's got about 20 million downloads at the time of this video.

04:03.860 --> 04:06.350
And what we want to do here is just select install.

04:07.130 --> 04:11.240
You'll see down here at the bottom some messages of installation messages.

04:11.480 --> 04:12.500
At this point, we're done.

04:12.500 --> 04:16.670
We've installed Visual Studio code and the C++ extension.

04:16.670 --> 04:22.400
So what I want to do now is just close this up and go right over here to my explorer and we are good

04:22.400 --> 04:22.940
to go now.

04:22.940 --> 04:29.040
So in the next video, what we'll do is we'll create a folder that will store some of our C++ projects.

04:29.060 --> 04:35.030
We'll create a small C++ program and we'll run that and I'll show you how to configure Visual Studio

04:35.030 --> 04:37.520
code to build and run that project.

04:37.520 --> 04:38.960
So I'll see you in the next video.
