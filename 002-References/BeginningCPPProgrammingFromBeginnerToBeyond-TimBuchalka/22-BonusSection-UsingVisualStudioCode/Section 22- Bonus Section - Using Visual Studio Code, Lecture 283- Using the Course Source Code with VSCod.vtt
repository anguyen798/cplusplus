00:05.200 --> 00:10.570
In this video, I'll show you how to use the source code provided for the course with Visual Studio

00:10.570 --> 00:11.140
code.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.780
First thing we need to do is get to the source code.

00:14.050 --> 00:19.370
The source code is provided in the course content and you can see right now it's in section 22.

00:19.390 --> 00:23.650
It's in a section called Extra Information Source Code and other stuff.

00:23.650 --> 00:26.860
And if you open that up, you'll see that source code for all sections.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.720
And it will bring you this page right here.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.270
Don't go off of section 22.

00:31.360 --> 00:36.550
If I add new sections to the course, that will get bumped down to 23, 24, 25.

00:36.550 --> 00:38.930
So I'm not sure where that will be when you watch the video.

00:38.950 --> 00:43.030
Just look for extra information, source code and other stuff.

00:43.060 --> 00:44.920
Open that up and you'll find the source code.

00:45.310 --> 00:50.560
Once you do that, there will be a link to a zip file for the source code for each section in the course.

00:50.950 --> 00:53.800
And if you want to download the source code, just click on the link.

00:54.340 --> 01:00.820
I've already done that and I've downloaded the source code for section four as a zip file and you can

01:00.820 --> 01:01.900
see it right here.

01:02.140 --> 01:03.700
There's the zip file right here.

01:03.770 --> 01:06.190
What I'm going to do is I'm just going to double click on it.

01:07.260 --> 01:09.600
And then extracts the Section four folder.

01:09.660 --> 01:13.570
So I'm just going to select Section four and I'm just going to move it over to my desktop.

01:13.590 --> 01:15.900
I'm just using the desktop and an example.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.910
You can move that to any folder you wish.

01:17.940 --> 01:21.750
What's really important is whatever folders you create, whatever names you use.

01:21.780 --> 01:26.120
Remember, no spaces, no international characters and no special characters.

01:26.130 --> 01:27.950
Otherwise, you may have build problems.

01:27.960 --> 01:32.940
So now once we've got that on our desktop, you can see our previous Section X course that I created

01:32.940 --> 01:34.230
in the previous videos.

01:34.230 --> 01:40.120
This section for what we need to do now is we need to open up this folder within Visual Studio code.

01:40.140 --> 01:44.880
You see, this folder has projects within it challenge solution, compiler errors, compiler warnings

01:44.880 --> 01:45.660
and so forth.

01:45.660 --> 01:50.430
Those will be the individual projects that will also be using within Visual Studio code.

01:50.430 --> 01:55.260
So I'm just going to close this and I'm going to head over to Visual Studio code right here, and I'm

01:55.260 --> 01:58.770
going to open Section four from my desktop.

02:00.050 --> 02:05.330
Make sure you open the section four folder, not the folders within section four.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.300
So I'll select open and there we go.

02:08.300 --> 02:13.280
You can see that the folder structure has now been opened within Visual Studio code and it just makes

02:13.280 --> 02:13.940
this a little bigger.

02:13.940 --> 02:18.770
So you can see that Section four right there and within Section four you've got the projects that I

02:18.770 --> 02:19.340
mentioned.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.570
We also have some other files.

02:20.570 --> 02:26.090
We have this dot code light folder and this Makefile in section four workspace and so forth.

02:26.090 --> 02:28.550
Those are all code light files.

02:28.550 --> 02:29.780
Don't worry about those.

02:29.780 --> 02:34.370
You can remove them if you like, or you can just leave them in and you can use your project with Visual

02:34.370 --> 02:35.930
Studio code or with code light.

02:35.930 --> 02:38.450
Visual Studio code will just ignore those files.

02:39.470 --> 02:40.400
So what do we do next?

02:40.400 --> 02:47.540
Well, we need to configure Visual Studio code to think of this section as a C plus plus section.

02:47.540 --> 02:47.810
Right.

02:47.810 --> 02:52.820
So what we need to do is we need to set up IntelliSense, we need to set up our default build task.

02:52.820 --> 02:57.500
And if we want to debug, we need to set up our launch JSON file.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.060
There's a couple of ways we can do that.

02:59.060 --> 03:02.570
We can do it manually, just like we did in the previous videos for this section.

03:02.570 --> 03:07.450
And that's what I'll do here again, just so you see it one more time, or you can grab that dot vs

03:07.490 --> 03:11.510
code folder that you've already created in those other projects and just move it into here.

03:11.510 --> 03:16.370
Just copy it right into section four and you'll be good to go, but I'm going to do it one step at a

03:16.370 --> 03:17.630
time, so let's do that.

03:18.420 --> 03:21.010
So the first thing we'll do is we'll open up any one of these.

03:21.010 --> 03:26.790
And I'm just going to open up, let's say first program and select the main CPP file within it.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.710
That's the program we'll use to configure.

03:28.710 --> 03:33.060
So what we'll do first is we'll go over here to view and the command palette.

03:34.110 --> 03:35.400
We'll type C++.

03:35.400 --> 03:41.310
And again, we're looking for C, C++, edit configurations UI right there, we'll select that and then

03:41.310 --> 03:42.990
we want to be sure we're using C++.

03:42.990 --> 03:47.460
So you come down to compiler path and whatever's there, just change it to G Plus.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.640
Plus, we've got that note.

03:49.710 --> 03:55.950
We'll scroll down a little bit further and look for the C++ 17 standard and we'll use C++ 17.

03:56.580 --> 03:57.240
That's it.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.900
I'm going to command S to save it and I'll close that up.

04:00.900 --> 04:07.200
So notice now our V code folder has been set up with our CP properties JSON file, so we're good to

04:07.200 --> 04:07.860
go here.

04:07.860 --> 04:10.380
Now what we're going to do is set up the default build test.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.960
So again, click on that main CP.

04:13.230 --> 04:16.320
This time you go up to terminal and down at the bottom.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.360
Configure default, build task.

04:18.630 --> 04:19.680
I'll select that.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.850
I'm going to use G plus plus, I'll select G plus plus.

04:23.850 --> 04:29.040
And this is the file we're going to make a couple of changes in in the ARGs section here on line eight,

04:29.040 --> 04:38.790
we're going to add dash w LX with W is capitalized and we're going to add dash speed equals C plus plus

04:39.360 --> 04:44.370
17 to tell the compiler to use the C++ standard just like that.

04:44.370 --> 04:48.930
If you're typing anything and you see squiggles like you're seeing right there, that means there's

04:48.930 --> 04:52.170
a typo somewhere you might have forgotten a quote mark or a comma.

04:52.170 --> 04:53.460
In this case, it's the comma.

04:53.940 --> 05:01.410
Then what we'll do is we'll take this file your name and we'll copy that right into line 12 and replace

05:01.410 --> 05:03.000
file with file your name.

05:03.180 --> 05:09.930
And once we do that, we have to add our slash start up CP to tell the compiler to compile all the files

05:09.930 --> 05:10.440
in there.

05:10.590 --> 05:11.190
That's it.

05:11.190 --> 05:12.240
So now we're done with that.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.890
We can now build our project.

05:13.890 --> 05:14.730
Let's try it out.

05:14.730 --> 05:18.240
So I'm going to close this out and I'm going to open my main CP again.

05:18.930 --> 05:25.440
Now, once I'm here, I can come up to terminal and run the build task or you can press shift command

05:25.470 --> 05:25.920
b.

05:27.030 --> 05:30.090
You can see down here we've got a build and it was successful.

05:30.300 --> 05:31.310
Always double check.

05:31.320 --> 05:37.860
You've got your minus G, your minus wall, you've got your standard C++ 17 and we've got our CP files

05:37.860 --> 05:40.050
being compiled at that point.

05:40.050 --> 05:45.390
Now we have this main executable that was created for us right here inside Project one.

05:45.390 --> 05:48.900
So I can right click on that and open it in the integrated terminal.

05:49.290 --> 05:53.700
We can do an LZ to see the files that we've got and we've got several files.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.080
Some of them are code light files.

05:55.080 --> 05:55.890
Don't worry about them.

05:55.890 --> 05:56.820
This dot mkay.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.140
And the dot project file.

05:58.140 --> 06:01.050
But we do have our main executable right here if we want to run it.

06:01.170 --> 06:07.830
We just type dot forward slash main and press enter enter your favorite number between one and 100,

06:07.830 --> 06:09.150
let's say 45.

06:09.510 --> 06:10.020
Amazing.

06:10.020 --> 06:11.460
That's my favorite number two.

06:11.460 --> 06:15.660
And you can see from the source code up here, that's exactly what the program is doing.

06:15.660 --> 06:18.750
So that's it for configuring for the build.

06:18.750 --> 06:23.790
Now, in order to configure for debugging, let me close this window here to make up a little more room.

06:24.000 --> 06:31.170
What we can do is again, we can select our main DHCP file and we can come up to run add configuration

06:31.170 --> 06:34.230
and select C++ gdb ltb.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.540
And G plus plus.

06:36.810 --> 06:39.450
Now, at this point, we're want to kill the debugger right here.

06:39.450 --> 06:42.930
We want to use that little red square right here icon to stop it.

06:42.930 --> 06:48.780
And what we want to do is we want to edit this launch JSON file that was created right there, which

06:48.780 --> 06:49.770
is open already.

06:49.920 --> 06:54.630
The only thing we want to do here is we want to change the type to LTB.

06:55.740 --> 07:00.390
When we do that, you'll notice we have some errors just like we had before in the previous videos.

07:00.390 --> 07:02.580
We just want to delete those lines.

07:02.580 --> 07:05.970
We don't want any squiggles or any red markers or anything anywhere.

07:06.450 --> 07:07.050
That's it.

07:07.050 --> 07:09.180
Your current working directory should be filed.

07:09.180 --> 07:09.780
Your name.

07:09.780 --> 07:10.890
Make sure that that's correct.

07:10.890 --> 07:13.650
If it's not, you can change it to that and that's it.

07:13.650 --> 07:15.720
I'll save that and we'll close this up.

07:16.260 --> 07:18.480
And now we can debug this program that's open.

07:18.480 --> 07:24.690
So I can click on the program and then select the debugger right over here on the left, that bug play

07:24.690 --> 07:26.070
icon run and debug.

07:26.100 --> 07:32.130
I can select that and it's waiting for us now to execute it by clicking on that green arrow up here.

07:32.520 --> 07:36.600
I do want to put a breakpoint in, so let's put a breakpoint right here on line seven.

07:36.960 --> 07:39.420
You can come across here, you'll see that red dot.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.700
There's a breakpoint showing up down here.

07:41.700 --> 07:46.560
If you see a lot of other breakpoints from other projects, clear them out and then just come in here

07:46.560 --> 07:48.060
and select the breakpoint you want.

07:48.450 --> 07:51.270
At this point, we can run it, so we'll just click on that red arrow.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.700
The debugger will engage.

07:54.210 --> 07:55.800
This bottom bar turns orange.

07:55.800 --> 07:58.260
You can see favorite number up here, set to zero.

07:58.260 --> 08:01.230
We never initialized it and we'll talk about that in the class.

08:01.320 --> 08:03.900
Our current executing line is line seven.

08:03.900 --> 08:09.210
So we can execute it by just stepping over, by pressing this icon right here and the output will be

08:09.210 --> 08:09.900
here in terminal.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.190
So you can always click there.

08:11.190 --> 08:13.290
So I'll do that and I'll do it one more time.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.450
It's asking me now for the favorite number.

08:15.450 --> 08:20.670
Again, I'll type 45 one more time and when I press enter now you'll see that I'm stopped at line nine

08:20.670 --> 08:23.790
and favorite numbers value has changed to 45.

08:23.790 --> 08:29.910
And as before, we can hover over that variable name and we can see our value to finish the program.

08:29.910 --> 08:33.780
You can click the play arrow or you can just stop it right here in the debugger.

08:33.780 --> 08:34.860
I'll just continue.

08:34.890 --> 08:35.640
That's it.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.720
So there you go.

08:36.720 --> 08:42.270
This video shows you how to set up the source code provided for the course to work within Visual Studio

08:42.270 --> 08:42.720
code.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.160
So now we can edit.

08:44.160 --> 08:47.040
We can debug and we can build and run.
