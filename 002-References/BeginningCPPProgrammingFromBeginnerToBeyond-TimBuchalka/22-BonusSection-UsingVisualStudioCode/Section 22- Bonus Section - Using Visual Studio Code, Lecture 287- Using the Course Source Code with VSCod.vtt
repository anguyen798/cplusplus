00:05.130 --> 00:06.120
Hello, everyone.

00:07.060 --> 00:07.660
In this video.

00:07.660 --> 00:13.930
What we'll do is we'll download and extract the source code provided in the course and we'll set it

00:13.930 --> 00:16.240
up so that we can use it with Visual Studio code.

00:16.900 --> 00:21.010
The source code is located in one of the last sections of the course.

00:21.010 --> 00:26.920
Right now it's in section 22, but that could change as I add content to the course that probably becomes

00:26.920 --> 00:29.650
section 23 and then 24 and so forth.

00:29.650 --> 00:35.830
So the best thing is to search for a section named extra information source code and other stuff, and

00:35.830 --> 00:40.090
in there there will be a video source code for all sections.

00:40.090 --> 00:44.830
And when you select that this is what you're going to get, it's a bunch of links to zip files that

00:44.830 --> 00:48.040
contain the source code for the course projects.

00:48.760 --> 00:52.840
So what you want to do is depending on which section of the course you're in, you want to download

00:52.840 --> 00:54.340
the zip file for that section.

00:54.340 --> 00:58.780
So in this case, I'm going to download the source code for section four and I'm just going to click

00:58.780 --> 01:03.340
on there and that will download a zip file, which I'm just going to save.

01:03.520 --> 01:08.530
Okay, now that I've saved it, I'm going to go to my downloads and I'm just going to extract it.

01:08.530 --> 01:12.430
So I'm just going to right click and extract right here.

01:14.340 --> 01:14.640
All right.

01:14.640 --> 01:15.900
So this is what we've got now.

01:15.900 --> 01:20.700
You can see it's extracted it to a section four folder, and inside that section for folder are all

01:20.700 --> 01:21.510
the projects.

01:21.510 --> 01:25.080
So what I want to do is I want to just copy this section for folder.

01:26.450 --> 01:31.400
Or you can cut it if you like to the desktop just so I can show you how to do it here.

01:33.220 --> 01:39.450
So now I've just downloaded and extracted all the projects in that section into this section four folder.

01:39.460 --> 01:40.630
So I think you know what to do.

01:40.630 --> 01:46.300
Now, what we want to do is we want to open up this section for folder in Visual Studio code and then

01:46.300 --> 01:50.080
set up IntelliSense, the task Jason and the launch JSON again.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.070
So let's do that.

01:51.490 --> 01:54.010
I'm going to close all this up because I don't need it anymore.

01:54.010 --> 01:56.440
And what I want to do now is I want to open a folder.

01:56.440 --> 02:02.050
So again, we'll open folder and I'm going to go to my desktop and I want to open section four.

02:02.770 --> 02:03.940
That's the one I want.

02:03.940 --> 02:04.960
So I'm just going to click.

02:04.960 --> 02:05.650
Okay.

02:06.370 --> 02:11.380
And now you'll see that Section four was opened up in Visual Studio code, which is exactly what we

02:11.380 --> 02:11.860
want.

02:12.070 --> 02:16.540
So also notice that there are some folders like code, light and Makefile and things like that.

02:16.540 --> 02:17.680
Don't worry about those.

02:17.680 --> 02:21.070
Those are things that code light needs Visual Studio.

02:21.070 --> 02:22.180
We'll just ignore them.

02:22.180 --> 02:26.770
But we need to configure this to work with Visual Studio, so we have to go through the same process

02:26.770 --> 02:28.180
that we did before.

02:28.180 --> 02:31.750
We have to do it once per major section.

02:31.780 --> 02:32.710
A couple of ways to do this.

02:32.710 --> 02:36.580
We could do it manually like we did before, which is what I'm going to do here, just so you can see

02:36.580 --> 02:43.360
it one more time, or you can copy your vs code folder from an existing project into this project.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.490
So let's just do it manually.

02:45.640 --> 02:51.910
First thing we want to do is I want to close this, get started and I want to click on any of the let's

02:51.910 --> 02:57.910
see this guy right here, any of the main CP files in there, any C++ source file is what we need.

02:58.090 --> 03:05.770
And then we're going to go to view command palette and type in again C plus plus until we see edit configurations

03:05.770 --> 03:06.460
UI.

03:07.260 --> 03:09.330
We're going to set up the IntelliSense again.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.710
We'll scroll down.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.730
And make sure that we've got.

03:13.750 --> 03:18.850
So we'll score right here to compile path and we want to be sure that we're using G plus plus right

03:18.850 --> 03:19.390
there.

03:19.960 --> 03:25.180
And then we're going to scroll down a little bit more to the C++ standard and we're going to choose

03:25.180 --> 03:26.590
C++ 17.

03:28.150 --> 03:28.690
That's it.

03:28.690 --> 03:31.900
I'm going to control SW to save and I'm done with that.

03:33.560 --> 03:34.250
Perfect.

03:34.340 --> 03:39.290
Now you notice we've got our code folder here and our CPP properties are set up.

03:39.440 --> 03:45.530
So again, I'm going to select Main CP and I'm going to come up to terminal and configure the default

03:45.530 --> 03:46.490
build task.

03:47.510 --> 03:49.940
I'm going to select G plus plus.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.980
And now once I'm here, I'm going to make those same changes we made before.

03:55.010 --> 03:56.880
I'm going to enable all warnings.

03:56.900 --> 04:07.250
So dash wall, we are going to enable the C++ 17 standard and we're going to change the file on line

04:07.250 --> 04:09.080
12 to file your name.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.180
Want to copy this and I'm going to paste it right in here.

04:17.180 --> 04:24.700
And then finally we're going to add the slash star TCP IP so that we'll compile all the files.

04:24.710 --> 04:27.860
Now, when we do these, you notice this sometimes you'll see squiggly.

04:27.860 --> 04:31.970
So for example, if I get rid of that comma, you'll see some squiggles show up, right?

04:32.000 --> 04:36.470
We don't want any of those are errors and we just want to be sure that everything looks clean.

04:36.470 --> 04:40.240
If something doesn't look clean, look at the video and make sure that you haven't missed any quote,

04:40.310 --> 04:41.900
marks or commas and so forth.

04:42.050 --> 04:43.220
So that's it.

04:43.220 --> 04:46.970
I'm going to save this and I'm going to close this up.

04:47.330 --> 04:52.580
Now what we'll do is we'll select main CPP on first program, and you can see what the first program

04:52.580 --> 04:55.280
is doing is similar to what we did before with the favorite number.

04:55.310 --> 04:57.170
What I want to do now is just test it out.

04:57.170 --> 05:02.180
So I'm going to select that and I'm going to go to terminal and run the build test.

05:02.180 --> 05:06.770
So that will build our project and you'll see builds finished successfully.

05:07.160 --> 05:13.100
So remember the main executable was created right here, right inside that project.

05:13.100 --> 05:18.830
So I'm going to right click on it, open an integrated terminal, and then I'm going to type dot slash

05:18.830 --> 05:19.400
main.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.890
What's my favorite number?

05:22.270 --> 05:23.690
It's 34 this time.

05:24.320 --> 05:24.860
Amazing.

05:24.860 --> 05:25.950
That's my favorite number, too.

05:25.970 --> 05:27.770
That's exactly what we're supposed to get.

05:28.810 --> 05:29.200
Okay.

05:29.200 --> 05:29.620
Perfect.

05:29.620 --> 05:37.840
So now let's say I wanted to run Project one, I can go to Main CP there and again I can come up to

05:37.840 --> 05:38.500
Terminal.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.440
Run build test.

05:40.450 --> 05:42.570
Now it's going to build project one.

05:42.590 --> 05:44.680
You could see from the message right here.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.870
You can see Project one is being built right there.

05:47.260 --> 05:52.540
We've created our executive role within Project One, which I can right click open to the integrated

05:52.540 --> 05:59.650
terminal and you can see Project one, just project one, we can run it again and now we're running

05:59.650 --> 06:00.300
Project one.

06:00.310 --> 06:04.520
So this is a really easy way to organize yourself and to get everything running nicely.

06:04.540 --> 06:05.570
We're done with that.

06:05.590 --> 06:08.410
The last step is to get the debugger working.

06:08.410 --> 06:12.460
So what we can do now again, select one of the main CP files.

06:12.460 --> 06:13.330
There's one.

06:14.160 --> 06:17.760
And we come up to run and add configuration.

06:19.450 --> 06:22.330
And select c++ gdb ltb.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.390
And then g plus.

06:24.390 --> 06:25.050
Plus.

06:26.980 --> 06:28.660
We're going to get some stuff happening.

06:28.960 --> 06:32.350
Whatever happens, just let it happen and then just kill it right here.

06:33.330 --> 06:35.550
So I'll press that little red square.

06:35.670 --> 06:40.950
And now what we want to do is we want to come back over to our explorer and we want to edit that launch

06:41.190 --> 06:42.120
JSON file.

06:42.120 --> 06:46.450
And all we really want to do is change this guy right here, this current working directory.

06:46.470 --> 06:51.750
I want to change that to file directory name so I'm just going to copy and paste.

06:54.790 --> 06:55.290
That's it.

06:55.300 --> 06:56.170
I'll save.

06:56.770 --> 06:58.930
And let's pick first program again.

06:58.930 --> 07:00.100
So we're right here.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.480
Let's say that this is the one we want to debug.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.600
So what we can do is we can click on the bug.

07:04.630 --> 07:07.290
If there are any breakpoints down here, we can clear them.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.880
We'll add our own breakpoint.

07:08.890 --> 07:13.570
Let's say we want to add a breakpoint right on line eight, and then we select that little green play

07:13.570 --> 07:14.590
button right up here.

07:15.920 --> 07:17.870
And the debugger will engage.

07:19.410 --> 07:24.250
You can see where we're stopped on line eight and you can see my favorite numbers over here.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.260
And we just move over.

07:25.290 --> 07:27.900
Now, you'll notice that we're getting three, two, seven, six, seven.

07:27.900 --> 07:28.910
What in the world is that?

07:28.920 --> 07:30.080
I don't see that anywhere.

07:30.090 --> 07:32.730
Well, we haven't initialized favorite number 20 thing.

07:32.730 --> 07:37.140
So whatever display's here really is undefined and I'll talk more about that in the class.

07:37.140 --> 07:39.750
That's really important issue with C++.

07:39.750 --> 07:41.940
So now we can just step through the program.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.700
Let's step through right here.

07:45.510 --> 07:48.150
Enter your favorite number between one and 100.

07:48.180 --> 07:52.380
So let's say I wanted to enter 56 and press enter.

07:53.070 --> 07:56.640
Now we're on my nine and I can step over that.

07:56.880 --> 08:02.790
Also notice my favorite number changed here and I can hover over to see that it's 56.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.770
And when we're done, we could just finish.

08:05.870 --> 08:06.560
And that's it.

08:06.770 --> 08:12.260
So that's how we can get the source code provided for the course to work with Visual Studio code.

08:12.290 --> 08:13.430
It's really pretty easy.

08:13.430 --> 08:18.080
Once you get the hang of it, you can set up the test JSON and launch JSON files really quickly.

08:18.170 --> 08:23.450
Or like I said, you could just copy them and paste them into the new structure that you're creating.

08:23.630 --> 08:23.960
All right.

08:23.960 --> 08:27.620
So that shows you how to set everything up for Linux Ubuntu.

08:27.650 --> 08:29.090
I'll see you in the rest of the course.
