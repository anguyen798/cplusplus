00:05.070 --> 00:05.790
Hello everyone.

00:05.790 --> 00:11.600
In this video I am going to download and install Visual Studio code on Linux.

00:11.610 --> 00:16.140
In this case I am running Ubuntu 20.0 for Ltsc.

00:16.170 --> 00:22.770
As you can see up here on the left top corner, Visual Studio code is available for lots of Linux distributions.

00:22.770 --> 00:25.350
So first order of business.

00:25.350 --> 00:26.040
Absolutely.

00:26.040 --> 00:30.300
Be sure that your compiler toolchain has already been installed and it's working.

00:30.300 --> 00:33.150
You can check that by opening up a terminal session.

00:34.790 --> 00:38.420
And just typing G plus plus dash dash version.

00:39.200 --> 00:45.170
And you should get some sort of display message that says G plus plus was a version number and so forth.

00:45.560 --> 00:49.910
If you get an error here, double check that your compiler is installed.

00:50.120 --> 00:55.280
Go back to section two of the course and refer to the videos there where I show you how to install your

00:55.280 --> 00:57.110
compiler toolchain on Linux.

00:57.320 --> 01:00.230
So I'm assuming that that's installed and it's all good to go.

01:00.260 --> 01:04.130
The next step is to actually install Visual Studio code.

01:04.160 --> 01:11.090
Open up your favorite browser and head over to code Visual Studio and you'll see a page that looks like

01:11.090 --> 01:11.660
this.

01:12.050 --> 01:16.880
There are lots of distributions of Visual Studio code for Linux, so if you click over here on the download

01:16.880 --> 01:17.450
button.

01:19.240 --> 01:25.000
You can see we've got for debian ubuntu, red hat, fedora, all kinds of different distributions.

01:25.030 --> 01:27.340
What I'm going to do is I'm going to make it really easy on myself.

01:27.340 --> 01:31.990
I'm assuming that if you know Linux and if you're working with Linux, you know how to use package managers,

01:31.990 --> 01:33.460
you know how to install software.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.680
So what I'm going to do is I'll make it really easy on myself.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.270
I'm going to select the Snap store.

01:38.060 --> 01:41.900
That's going to take me another page where I could just click install over here on the right top with

01:41.900 --> 01:42.830
this green button.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.080
And I've got a couple of choices.

01:45.080 --> 01:50.570
I can view it in my desktop store, which is this guy right there, my ubuntu software or I can install

01:50.570 --> 01:51.380
snap if you like.

01:51.380 --> 01:53.330
If you don't have snap installed, you can install it.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.250
So I'm just going to view it in the desktop store.

01:56.330 --> 01:59.390
I'm going to choose my application which is the Ubuntu store.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.160
You can use Snap store if you want.

02:01.280 --> 02:04.970
I'll just open the link and that's going to take me right here.

02:05.390 --> 02:07.820
Let me minimize my browser window.

02:07.820 --> 02:12.080
I don't need it anymore and now I'm just going to install just going to click install.

02:12.080 --> 02:13.640
You put in my password.

02:15.070 --> 02:15.520
And that's it.

02:15.550 --> 02:17.540
Now it's installing Visual Studio code.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.240
It's done.

02:18.250 --> 02:21.460
So what I need to do now is basically just close up this window.

02:22.500 --> 02:23.100
And run it.

02:23.110 --> 02:27.870
So let me go down here and you should see Visual Studio code installed now.

02:28.050 --> 02:29.370
There it is right here.

02:29.370 --> 02:30.360
Click on that.

02:30.510 --> 02:34.800
And when Visual Studio first loads up, you'll get a screen that looks something like this.

02:34.920 --> 02:39.780
It's a getting started page with some information about opening files and so forth, and we'll do that

02:39.780 --> 02:40.470
in a little bit.

02:40.470 --> 02:46.140
But before we do that, we need to install an extension, the C++ extension, which will allow Visual

02:46.140 --> 02:48.600
Studio code to work with C++.

02:48.600 --> 02:53.430
So what we want to do is we want to come over here on the left and select these icons, this icon right

02:53.430 --> 02:54.450
here, extensions.

02:54.450 --> 02:57.660
You want to select that, and now you're going to get a bunch of choices.

02:57.660 --> 03:02.790
You can see that the installed extensions are zero as I haven't installed anything, I've just installed

03:02.790 --> 03:04.830
Visual Studio code fresh out of the box.

03:04.830 --> 03:07.050
So there are no extensions installed.

03:07.050 --> 03:13.140
The one we want to install is this one right here, the C C++ extension from Microsoft.

03:13.170 --> 03:14.760
It should be under popular.

03:14.760 --> 03:19.050
If you don't see it, you can type C++ in the search box and press enter.

03:19.850 --> 03:21.130
And then you'll see it right away.

03:21.140 --> 03:25.970
So if you just select that this is the one you'll know because it's this big circle with some purple,

03:25.970 --> 03:31.580
white and black and it says C, C plus, plus Microsoft with just over 20 million downloads at the time

03:31.580 --> 03:32.610
of this recording.

03:32.630 --> 03:33.770
That's the one we want.

03:33.800 --> 03:38.930
We want to select, install, and you'll see the installation proceed down here on the right.

03:39.590 --> 03:40.760
Once it's finished.

03:40.760 --> 03:42.170
We are good to go.

03:42.740 --> 03:44.540
So just give it a few minutes to finish.

03:44.540 --> 03:45.320
Don't interrupt it.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.580
Just let it do its thing.

03:49.600 --> 03:49.990
Okay.

03:49.990 --> 03:50.890
So it's done.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.450
We'll close this up.

03:53.680 --> 03:56.290
And we will go back here to explore.

03:56.950 --> 03:58.210
And we're good to go.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.420
So the next thing we're going to do is we're going to create a folder.

04:01.420 --> 04:06.670
And inside that folder, we're going to create a project which is going to include a real simple C++

04:06.670 --> 04:13.750
program that will allow us to configure Visual Studio code so that we'll build, run and debug that

04:13.750 --> 04:14.170
file.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.060
So I'll see you in the next video to do that.
