00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.270
In this section, we'll talk
about characters and strings.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.220
As we've already seen, the
character type can hold values

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.550
that represent characters.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.320
These values are basically integers
that match to a character set

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:19.080
like the ASCII character set.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.300
And we've also seen that strings
are sequences of characters.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.729
C++ supports two types of strings,
c-style strings and c++ strings.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.250
So will first look at
the cctype library.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.559
This is a library a very simple
but very useful functions

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.760
that work with characters.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.700
For example, we can test
characters to see if they're

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.080
uppercase to lowercase, numeric,
alphanumeric, punctuation and more.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.739
We can also convert characters
between lower and uppercase.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.799
After we learn about the cctype
functions, we'll talk about strings.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.860
As I said earlier, you can think of
strings is a sequence of characters.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.550
So far, we've only used
string literals, which were

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.660
represented as a sequence of
characters inside double quotes.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.959
I'll discuss both c-style strings
and c++ strings in this section and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.679
give you the basics of using each.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.450
However, you should be using
c++ strings in modern c++.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.750
I think you'll understand why
at the end of this section.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.470
First we'll see what c-style
strings are and how they

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.680
represented in memory.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.739
Then we'll see how to work with
c-style strings using some of the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.339
string functions available in the
cstring and cstandard lib libraries.

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.589
Then we'll learn about c++ strings.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.170
C++ strings are objects,
just like are vectors were.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.840
And they're used using an
object-oriented style of programming.

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.870
In this section, will learn
how to declare, initialize,

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:47.820
assign, compare and use some of
the other c++ string methods.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.330
Methods are functions
that work with objects.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.120
So let's look at c-style
strings first in the next video.
