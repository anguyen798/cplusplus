Hello, and welcome to Beginning C++ Programming.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.130
Thank you very much for enrolling in this course

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.690
and placing your confidence in the Learn Programming Academy team

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.220
and in me for your training.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.020
In this video, I'd like to introduce you to the course.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.820
But first, I'd like to introduce myself.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.920
My name is Frank Mitropoulos, and I'll be your instructor for this course.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.150
You can read more about me in the course bio.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.850
But I want you to be sure that I will do everything I can to make sure the course content is correct,

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.350
relevant, understandable and hopefully, fun.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.150
I've been a university computer science professor for many years.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.450
I've also worked in industry as a programmer, software engineer and project manager.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.750
I've taught thousands of students in both academia and industry how to program,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.750
using many programming languages.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.950
But c++ is my favorite language to teach.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.950
I first learned c++ back in 1988,

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.100
and I've used it ever since. That's quite a long time ago, and c++ has evolved

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.100
greatly since then.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.060
I'm very excited to teach this course.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.660
I hope you're also excited about learning c++.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.760
In this course, I assume that you're completely new to c++.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.810
I also assume that you have little if any programming experience with other programming languages.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.860
If you do have programming experience, that's great. This course is still for you

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.860
since you'll definitely learn c++.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.460
The course curriculum has been developed in a way that introduces new topics

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.960
in a specific order.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.160
I encourage you to follow along one section at a time.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.160
Before you know it, you'll be writing c++ programs that solve problems.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.750
In this course, I'll cover modern c++.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.750
I'll talk more about just exactly what modern c++

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.350
is as we go through the course.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.650
But rest assured that you'll be learning c++ as it should be used today.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.190
Over the years, I've worked with many, many students,

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.190
and I can only remember a few that just didn't get programming.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.390
I still think that if they tried a little harder than programming would have clicked at some point.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.280
If you're new to programming, you will, at some point in this course, feel frustrated.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.880
This is perfectly normal.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.880
Programming is a skill that must be learned and practiced.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.630
You play a musical instrument?

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.180
Do you remember what it sounded like the first time you played?

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.280
Do you remember wanting to smash that guitar or piano because you just couldn't get it?

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.030
Programming is similar. You must practice and practice to get better.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.130
If you get frustrated, take a break and try again a bit later.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.730
Remember, we've all been there.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.090
I still remember the first program I ever wrote. It was back in 1980

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.090
using a programming language called Fortran 77.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.250
I was so excited that I was able to program a computer to do exactly what I wanted it to do.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.950
The program was pretty simple. It asked the user for an amount in US dollars

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.550
and then displayed how many quarters, dimes,nickels and pennies

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.550
it would take to add up to that entered amount.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.850
We'll do the same problem in this course.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.710
I also remember that it took me a couple,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.110
okay maybe more than a couple of attempts before it was correct.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.510
But man what a great feeling when it ran correctly.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.410
In this course, each section ends with a challenge exercise.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.910
These will help reinforce the concepts presented in the section to help in learning the material.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.870
Once you've finished the challenge, don't stop there, challenge yourself.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.970
Come up with similar problems on your own and solve them

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.070
then do it again and again. Make it fun, make the problem silly if you want to.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.270
It doesn't matter. It's all about practice.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.670
Finally, if you have any questions at all, please ask them in the forums.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.270
I will personally monitor the forums and respond to questions.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.870
Before you post though,

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.270
browse the already answered questions since your question may already have an answer.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.030
Well, enough talk. I look forward to working with everyone.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.030
Let's start learning c++.
