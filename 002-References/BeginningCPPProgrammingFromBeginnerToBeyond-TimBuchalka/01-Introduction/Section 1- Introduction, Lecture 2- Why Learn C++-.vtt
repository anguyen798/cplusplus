00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.400
One question that students often ask when they're considering a career

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.000
in software development is what programming language should I learn?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000
There's really no easy answer to that question.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Experienced professional programmers generally know many

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.300
programming languages and use them based on many factors.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.600
The question I'd like to address in this video is why learn C++.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.100
Let's start with C++ popularity.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.200
Much, if not most of the software written today is still written in C++

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.860
and this has been the case for many, many years.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.520
There are many programming language popularity indexes

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.020
that use different criteria for ranking the popularity of programming languages.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.820
Let's head over to a browser and we'll look at a few of them.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.720
I've opened up a browser,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.980
and I've loaded several sites that rank programming languages based on popularity.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.630
All of the data I'm showing is current as of November 2017.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.930
So depending on when you access the site, your results may differ.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.030
Each site uses their own criteria and I encourage you to browse through these sites.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.230
I've provided the URLs for these sites in the course resources.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.990
First let's look at the Tobi index. As you can see,

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.290
++ is currently ranked third.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.590
If you select that row,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.390
you can learn more about C++ popularity since 2001.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.380
It's pretty impressive for language to be ranked so consistently for so long

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.580
considering how many new languages and frameworks appear on the scene.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.930
The next site is the PYPL popularity index.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.180
As you can see C++ is currently ranked sixth.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.880
Next, we'll look at the IEEE Spectrum Rankings.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.580
On IEEE Spectrum, C++ is ranked number four.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.180
The Redmonk ranking has C++ at number six.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.980
And finally, we'll take a look at Zdnet's rankings,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.540
they combine popular indexes and create an ensemble ranking,

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.840
which shows C++ at number four.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.940
They also provide an analysis of the data that's a good read.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.040
Let's return to the slides.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.940
As you can see from these sites,

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.740
C++ is still a very popular language among software developers

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.890
and the ranking is consistently high.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.190
If you go to GitHub,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.790
you'll see that there's a huge number of active C++ repositories,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.290
and C++ is also extremely active on stack overflow.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.690
Popularity is important, but C++ is also a relevant language.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.290
There are many, many leading software titles written entirely or partly in C++.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.090
These include the windows, Linux and MacOS 10 operating systems,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.700
many of the adobe products such as photoshop and illustrator,

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.700
the mysql and mongodb database engines and many, many more.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.290
Leading tech companies UC++ for many of their

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.390
products and internal research and development.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.750
These include Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, PayPal,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.750
Google Facebook, Oracle and more.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.650
Finally. The types of projects that C++ is being used on

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.650
are pretty cool.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.650
In many cases, these are the engines that drive many popular frameworks.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.250
For example, engines for virtual reality, the unreal game engine,

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.150
machine learning, network and telecom and more.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.550
There are many reasons why C++ is so popular and relevant,

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.850
but the main reason is because it's so powerful.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.050
What do I mean by powerful? C++ is super fast.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.250
It's a general purpose programming language that supports both

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.650
procedural and object-oriented programming, making it very flexible.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.150
It scales easily and it can also be portable.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.550
C++ can do many things that other languages just can't,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.750
that's why nearly every major language has a way to interface

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.410
with the code written in C++.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.710
With all this power and flexibility comes complexity,

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.610
there's no question that C++ is one of the most complex

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.600
programming languages out there but learning the basics is pretty easy

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.200
and that's what this course is all about.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.600
Finally, you've probably heard that C++ programmers command higher salaries.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.600
This is true.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.050
You may have even heard the phrase C++ equals salary++.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.650
Career opportunities are out there for C++ programmers.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.650
I've consulted for many years with major U.S corporations

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.650
on the hiring of software developers.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.450
This includes full stack developers, java developers

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.950
iOS and android developers and C++ developers.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.110
Having C++ skills on your resume

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.110
is often like a badge of honor amongst software developers,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.410
and many times it'll get you that job interview. Why?

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.970
Because C++ programmers have a skill set

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.370
that sets them apart from many other programmers.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.120
One final thought, since so many programming languages

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.220
are influenced by C++,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.320
learning new languages is often easier since you already have solid foundation

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.820
in a root programming language, like C++.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.620
As you can see you've made a good choice in learning C++.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.320
In the next video, we'll briefly look at the evolution of C++

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.820
and the C++ standard.
