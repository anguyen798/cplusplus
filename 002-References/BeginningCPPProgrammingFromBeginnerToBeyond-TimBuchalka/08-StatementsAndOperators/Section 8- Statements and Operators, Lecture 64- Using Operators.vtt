00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.500
C++ has a rich set of operators

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.700
that can be used to build up expressions.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.400
Most of the c++ operators are binary operators,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.800
which means they operate on two operands.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.300
For example, the multiplication operator.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.800
However,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.600
some are unary operators, which means they operate on only one operand.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.300
An example of this is the unary minus operator, which simply negates its operand.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.400
There's even a ternary operator that operates on three operands.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.900
This is the conditional operator.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.700
The c++ common operators can be grouped into several categories.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.700
Assignment operators are used to modify the value of some object

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.300
by assigning a new value to it.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.780
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on operands.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.380
The increment and decrement operators are interesting

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.280
because part of them work like an assignment and part of them work like arithmetic.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.480
They're super useful and very commonly used.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.380
Relational operators or comparison operators

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.980
allow you to compare the values of two objects.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.180
These are very useful and include equal to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.980
not equal to less than greater than and so forth.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.280
The logical operators are used to test for logical or Boolean conditions.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.500
For example, if you want to execute a specific statement

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.300
only when the temperature is less than freezing and it isn't snowing, 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.500
these include the logical not, and, and or operators.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.760
There are also several member access operators.We've already seen one of them.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.060
Remember, the array subscript operator.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.760
It allows access to a specific member.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.020
There are others that work with objects and pointers,which we'll cover later in this course.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.270
Finally, there's the other category.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.470
This includes those operators that really don't fit very well into the previous categories.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.570
In the next several videos, we'll head over to CodeLite

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.570
and see some examples of these operators in live code.
