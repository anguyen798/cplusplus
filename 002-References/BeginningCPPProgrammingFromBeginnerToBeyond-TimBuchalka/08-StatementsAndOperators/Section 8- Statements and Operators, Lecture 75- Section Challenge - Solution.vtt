00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.900
Okay so welcome to the section 8 challenge solution.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.290
I hope you were able to solve this problem,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.790
and I hope it was fun to do. And I hope you tested it and

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.090
tweaked it, made it your own,added some features to it and so forth.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.790
Let me just go through a couple of solutions. First, we'll do the solution

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.990
without using the modulo operator.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.990
So I'm going to scroll up here, and let me just explain what I've got going on. Here's

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.490
my main, right at the beginning.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.090
Okay. So I've defined conversion constants. These are just simple integers,

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.190
and it's the value in cents of a dollar, a quarter, a dime and a nickel.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.850
Okay. So a dollar is 100 cents, a quarter is 25 cents and so forth.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.250
Then I've got another integer called change amount.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.850
This is what I'm asking the user to enter.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.750
All right. So let's suppose that we're entering 92 here,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.450
and we'll walk through a simple example.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.250
Here, I'm declaring all the variables that I'm going to need:

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.150
dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies are going to contain

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.510
the number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies that I need to provide the change.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.110
And then I'm going to have another variable called balance,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.910
and that's going to be a balance, a running balance. So every time that I figure out

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.910
I need two dollars and I'm going to subtract two dollars from the original amount

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.270
until I get down to zero.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.870
Okay. So that's my algorithm or my solution

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.170
is basically to determine how much of the highest currency I need

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.970
and then subtract that and have a running balance until it becomes zero.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.290
All right. So let's do this example here.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.890
And I'm just going to write some letters over here. I'll write dollars,

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.490
quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.690
So we can keep it running.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.890
And I'll have a balance variable here as well.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.990
All right. So let's start. We're right over here on line 57,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.390
and we need to figure out how many dollars

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.690
are in 92 cents. Well, there are none, right.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.190
So what we want to do is we want to divide the change amount which in this case is 92

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.650
divide that by the dollar value which is a 100 cents per dollar.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.850
In this case, that's going to give me a 0.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.210
Remember, we're using integer division here. So I'm going to get to 0,

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.710
which says no dollars.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.710
Makes sense, right because I've got less than 100 cents.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.110
Now I need to update my balance.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.410
Well, how do I do that? I decrement however many dollars times a 100.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.610
Well, I had 0 here, right. So in this case, the change amount is going to be 92

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.210
and I'm going to subtract from that

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.910
0 times 100.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.410
Okay. So in this case, I'm not subtracting anything. My balance becomes 92.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.970
Okay. So that's the first step.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.570
Now we need to determine how many quarters we need.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.170
So I'm going to take that balance, which is 92.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.220
And I'm going to divide it by the quarter's value which is 25 cents.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.320
And that will give me a 3,

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.020
right. 75 cents so I need 3 quarters.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.740
Now what I want to do is I want to subtract that 75 cents from the 92.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.740
And in this case, I'm using a compound operator right here, the minus equals.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.840
So all I'm saying is balance equals balance minus the right-hand side.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.240
Well, the right-hand side is 3 quarters

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.040
times 25 cents each, which is the 75.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.440
Okay. So I'm going to subtract 75 from the balance,

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.040
which is going to give me 17. So that's my current balance.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.440
Now I can work on the dimes. How many dimes?

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.640
Well, it's the balance which is 17 divided by 10 cents per dime.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.240
So this is going to give me 1. So that's 1 dime.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.900
And I'm going to do the same thing here. Hopefully, you can see what's going on.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.800
I'm going to subtract 1 dime which is 10 cents each from the balance.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.400
So I'm going to subtract 10 from the balance, gives me 7.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.390
Now I'm going to figure out how many nickels I need,

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.790
7 divided by 5 cents per nickel. So I need 1 nickel.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.090
I subtract 5 from the 7, and I end up with 2.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.790
My balance is the number of pennies I need.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.090
I don't need to do any more calculations, and that gives me the 2 pennies,

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.850
and we're basically done. So if we add up all of this, let's test this out,

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.250
this is going to give me 0, this is going to give me 25

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.750
times 3 which is 75 cents, 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.750
this will give me the 75, this will give me 10,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.410
1 times 10, 1 times 5, and 2 times 1.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.570
If I add all those guys up, I should have 75, 85, 92,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:32.530
exactly what I expected.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.910
Okay. So that gives you an example of one way to approach this.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.680
We'll do it really quickly with another example here.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.480
Let's say we wanted to use something like 267.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.720
So let me clear this, and I'll go through this one really quickly this time.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.320
So let's say it's 267 is the amount that the user entered.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.120
Okay. So here, how many dollars? Well, 267

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.920
divided by 100, right. 100 cents

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.920
dollar that's going to give me 2 dollars.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.020
Then what I want to do is I want to subtract, I'll run my balance up here

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.220
those 200

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.620
which gives me 67 cents. That's my balance.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.920
How many quarters in 67 cents,

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.820
divide that by 25, that gives me 2 quarters,

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.620
which is 50 cents. I'm subtracting 50 cents,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.920
and we're right back to where we were with the other problem where we've got 17.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.420
How many dimes divide that by 10, it gives me 1 dime,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.820
that's 10 cents. I subtract 10 from that. I end up with 7.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.920
How many nickels, divide that by five. It gives me 1 nickel.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.880
And I've got 2 left, which is my pennies,

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.980
right. So this gives us

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.280
right here 100 times 2, it gives us the 200.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.180
This gives me 50. This gives me 10, 5 and 2.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.540
Add all that up, I get 250, 260, 270.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.340
I'm sorry 200, 250, 267,

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.630
which is exactly what we started out with.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.330
Okay now we can take advantage of something here.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.930
If you notice if I have 267

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.590
and I divide that by 100, let's say, that gives me 2 dollars integer division.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.290
But notice that I have a remainder.

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.490
My remainder is 67, right.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.370
That's where we can use the modulo operator to rework this a little bit.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:33.470
So we'll do that next.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.970
Okay. So let's look at another solution. This time we'll be using the modulo operator.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.400
So suppose the user enters 267

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.900
for the change amount.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.400
And I've put all these on the same file. That way you can

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.400
play around with both of them a lot easier.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.060
So in this case, I'm zeroing everything out just like when we started.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.660
So I've got 267 cents, that's what the user has entered,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.460
and we'll just keep a running total over here for the dollars,

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.460
the quarters, the dimes, the nickels and the pennies.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.060
Okay. So how many dollars? Well, we divide 267 by

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.260
100 cents per dollar, and that gives us the 2 dollars.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.560
So we definitely need that. Now rather than subtract

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.260
the 2 times 100 from the 267 as we did before,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.760
we can take advantage of the modulo operator.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.060
So in this case, the change amount is 267

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.760
mod 100, right.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:34.620
This gives us 2 with a remainder of 67.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.120
So the effect is exactly like

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.820
subtracting 200 from 267.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.520
Okay. So what we can do is we'll keep our balance down here this time just to have a little bit more room.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.220
In this case, our balance is going to be 67.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.920
That's what we just assigned right here.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.620
Now let's figure out how many quarters we have. Well, our balance is 67,

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:00.320
divide that by 25 cents per quarter and that gives us 2 quarters.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.420
So now again instead of subtracting 50 from 67,

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.820
we could just use the modular operator. Here, I'm using the compound operator.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.120
So it's balance equals balance mod quarter value.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:15.420
Same idea. So balance is 67

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.320
mod 25,

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.370
gives us 2 quarters right. That's 50

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.970
with a remainder of 17. So our balance becomes 17.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.270
And then from this point forward, I think you could see what's happening.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:32.870
Our balance is now 17

00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.070
divided by 10 cents per dime, gives us 1 dime.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:42.870
And then we do the same modular operator. So we're going to have 17

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.670
mod 10,

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.930
gives us 1 with a remainder of 7.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.530
That's really what we care about as a remainder in this case.

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.290
How many nickels,

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.790
7 divided by 5 cents per nickel,

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.390
it gives us 1 nickel.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.390
And then we do the mod operator one last time, we're going to say

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.390
the balance would be 7,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.890
which is my balance, mod 5 which gives me a 1 with a remainder of 2.

00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:12.990
At that point, our balance is 2 which is the number of pennies that are left.

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:17.990
And again if we add this up, we're going to have 2 dollars here, which is 200.

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:23.090
We've got 50 cents here, 10 cents here,

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.030
5 cents here and 2 cents here,

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:29.020
which gives us 200, 250, 267.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.890
okay. Another approach to me this approach -- I'll clear this so it's not so cluttered real quick.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.190
To me this approach, as I read it, looks

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:41.590
easier to follow than the other approach,

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:45.690
but they're both really doing the same thing. It's just a matter of preference and documentation.

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:50.490
So that's it. I hope these two solutions were pretty close to yours.
