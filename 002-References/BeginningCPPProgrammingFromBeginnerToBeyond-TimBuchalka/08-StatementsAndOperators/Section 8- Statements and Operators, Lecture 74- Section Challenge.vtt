Welcome to the section 8 challenge.

1
00:08.300 --> 00:11.600
For this program, I'm going to be using US dollars and cents,

2
00:11.600 --> 00:15.200
but feel free to use whatever currency system you're familiar with that you want to use.

3
00:16.080 --> 00:20.580
The idea here is you want to write a program that asks the user to enter the following.

4
00:20.780 --> 00:23.780
Ask them to enter an integer representing the number of cents.

5
00:24.280 --> 00:27.780
You can assume that the number of cents entered is greater than or equal to zero.

6
00:28.180 --> 00:31.680
The program then displays how to provide that change to the user.

7
00:31.680 --> 00:36.080
So in the U.S, we have one dollar is a hundred cents, a quarter is 25 cents,

8
00:36.080 --> 00:40.480
a dime is 10 cents, a nickel is 5 cents, and a penny is one cent.

9
00:40.530 --> 00:44.030
So in this example suppose the user enters 92 cents.

10
00:44.580 --> 00:48.080
Your results will display that you can provide this change as follows.

11
00:48.080 --> 00:49.280
No dollars.

12
00:49.280 --> 00:51.480
Three quarters that would be 75 cents.

13
00:51.480 --> 00:54.780
A dime, which would be another 10 cents that would give you 85.

14
00:54.780 --> 00:58.980
The nickel is 5., there's your 90. And the two pennies, there's your 92.

15
00:59.780 --> 01:02.080
As I said feel free to use your own currency system.

16
01:02.080 --> 01:06.080
Also think of how you might want to solve this problem using the modulo operator.

17
01:06.080 --> 01:08.580
When i give you my solution, I'll have two solutions.

18
01:08.580 --> 01:12.780
I'll have one without the modulo operator and one that uses the modulo operator,

19
01:12.780 --> 01:16.180
just so you can see two different ways to approach the problem. Quick hint,

20
01:16.180 --> 01:20.170
please don't just sit down and start coding this. Think about how you want to solve it.

21
01:20.170 --> 01:24.730
Write down some pseudocode that's English-like statements so you can get your thoughts straight.

22
01:24.730 --> 01:28.830
Figure out what your algorithm is or your steps that you want to use to solve the program.

23
01:28.830 --> 01:32.930
So have fun, make sure you test your program. Don't forget to test zero.

24
01:33.430 --> 01:35.430
Don't forget to test large numbers.

25
01:35.430 --> 01:39.930
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a couple of sample runs just so you can see how this works.

26
01:40.430 --> 01:42.790
So in this example it says enter an amount in cents.

27
01:42.790 --> 01:45.090
So let's say I type in 92 cents.

28
01:45.790 --> 01:49.590
And the program responds you can provide change for this as follows.

29
01:50.250 --> 01:53.550
Dollar zero, three quarters, one dime,

30
01:53.550 --> 01:56.550
one nickel, two pennies, just like we would expect.

31
01:56.800 --> 01:59.400
As I mentioned don't forget to test with zero,

32
01:59.900 --> 02:02.260
and we should get all zeros straight down the line.

33
02:03.360 --> 02:05.720
And let's say we want to test

34
02:06.020 --> 02:09.820
this with 267 cents, that's 2 dollars and 67 cents.

35
02:11.120 --> 02:14.720
In this case, we've got our two dollars, we've got two quarters. That gives us 50,

36
02:14.970 --> 02:16.770
the dime gives us 60,

37
02:16.770 --> 02:19.970
the nickel 65 and the two pennies 67.

38
02:19.970 --> 02:23.630
So there are your 267 cents. All right. So

39
02:23.630 --> 02:24.620
have a go at it.

40
02:24.620 --> 02:28.220
And when you come back, go to the solutions section. I'll go over my solution.

41
02:28.820 --> 02:29.420
Good luck.
