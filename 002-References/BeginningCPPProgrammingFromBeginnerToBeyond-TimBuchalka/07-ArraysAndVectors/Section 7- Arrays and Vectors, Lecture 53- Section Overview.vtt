00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.700
In this section of the course, weâ€™ll learn about our first compound data type.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.800
A compound type is to type that's made up of other types.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.500
First, we'll learn about arrays, what they are and why we use them?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.300
We'll go over the syntax for declaring and initializing arrays,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.700
and we'll learn how to access the individual elements of an array.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.600
Then we'll talk about multidimensional arrays.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.480
These can be two-dimensional or three-dimensional arrays

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.480
or they can be as many dimensions as you need.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.880
They can be very useful for modeling grids, boards and much more complex data types.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.780
Then weâ€™ll learn about vectors. Vectors are better than arrays in so many ways,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.440
and we'll discuss their advantages.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.430
In fact, in modern c++, we rarely use raw arrays,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.930
instead we use vectors. So why cover arrays at all?

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.230
I think it's important to understand arrays

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.330
since there's so much legacy c++ code out there.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.530
And conceptually, they're easy to understand

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.530
and will add to your overall knowledge in c++.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.130
Okay, so let's get started learning about our first compound data type, arrays.
