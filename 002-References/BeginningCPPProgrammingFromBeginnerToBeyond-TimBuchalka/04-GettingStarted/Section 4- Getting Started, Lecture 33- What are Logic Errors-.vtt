00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.860
In this video, we'll talk about logic errors and why they can happen.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.160
Logic errors, or errors or bugs in your code

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.860
that cause your program to run incorrectly.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.060
Logic errors are mistakes made by a programmer.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.900
Sometimes the mistakes are careless of the time.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.890
Some mistakes are because the programmers have incomplete or incorrect information.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.760
Other times mistakes occur when one programmer modifies another programmer's code

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.960
to fix or add something, and they introduce an error as they do this.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.320
There are many, many causes for logic errors.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.980
It doesn't matter what the cause is though, they need to be corrected.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.480
We need to test our code and debug it to find incorrect errors.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.180
Suppose we have a program that determines if a person can vote in an election

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.040
and you must be 18 years old or older to vote.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.230
We haven't talked about if statements yet in this class.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.730
But they're very intuitive and I'm sure you'll follow this little piece of code.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.940
First, we test to see if the age is greater than 18.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.340
If it is, then we execute the code that's inside those curly braces.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.230
Do you see the error.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.230
Itâ€™s pretty easy to see it here because the code is isolated,

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.530
and I told you there was an error.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.830
However, in reality, there's much more code typically involved.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.830
In this may just be a small part of a much larger program.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.880
The problem with this code is that the test conditions should be greater than

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.480
or equal to 18 or greater than 17,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.580
either one will work.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.240
As it's written now, 18 year old would not be able to vote.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.940
We'll talk about testing throughout the course in the context of

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.240
learning c++ and best practices.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.900
Well, that wraps up this section.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.100
Next, you can take the section quiz and attempt the challenge exercise and see how you do.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.400
I'm sure you'll do great. If you have any questions, please post them to the course forum.
