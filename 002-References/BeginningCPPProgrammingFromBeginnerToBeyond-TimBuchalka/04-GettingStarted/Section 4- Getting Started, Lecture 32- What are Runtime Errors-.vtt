00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.300
In this video, we'll talk about runtime errors and why they can happen.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.700
As the name suggests, runtime errors are errors that happened

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.700
when the program is executing.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.300
These types of errors can be difficult to predict when we're writing our program.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.020
These errors include divided by zero errors, file not found errors,

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.220
out of memory errors in many, many more.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.220
Some runtime errors can cause your program to crash.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.520
We use exception handling to help us know when runtime errors happen

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.220
so we can try to recover from them.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.590
We'll see examples of runtime errors later in this course,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.790
when we work with files. We'll also work with exception handling toward the end of the course.
