00:05.180 --> 00:06.260
Hello, everyone.

00:06.260 --> 00:10.580
In this video, I want to give you a tour of the code light interface.

00:10.580 --> 00:14.750
The version of Code Light that I'm using here is 17 .3.0.

00:14.780 --> 00:20.000
This version is more recent than the versions that I used when I recorded the videos for the course.

00:20.030 --> 00:22.580
Overall, they are very, very similar.

00:22.580 --> 00:25.640
Sure, you're going to see a couple of differences in the user interface.

00:25.640 --> 00:31.130
Some things have been cleaned up and made more streamlined, but the basic functionality of the IDE,

00:31.370 --> 00:37.250
namely creating workspaces, creating projects, editing the code, building and running the code have

00:37.250 --> 00:38.180
not changed.

00:38.180 --> 00:40.250
So let me give you a quick tour here.

00:40.250 --> 00:45.170
When you first open up code light, if you don't have a workspace already open since the last time you

00:45.200 --> 00:47.720
saved it, you'll get a screen that looks like this.

00:47.720 --> 00:51.590
Over here on the left side, you'll see the workspace view.

00:51.800 --> 00:55.490
This is where the workspace and projects will reside.

00:55.490 --> 00:58.910
There aren't any open now because I don't have a workspace open yet.

00:58.910 --> 01:02.540
Over here in the center, you see these four big buttons.

01:02.570 --> 01:06.270
Again, that might change in the future, but right now we're going to use two of them.

01:06.270 --> 01:11.130
We're going to open an existing workspace and we're going to create a new workspace down at the bottom.

01:11.130 --> 01:13.410
We can see recently opened workspaces.

01:13.410 --> 01:17.280
So you can see that I've already opened three workspaces and I did that.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.110
So you can see something down here.

01:19.110 --> 01:22.860
Very likely the first time you run code light, you're not going to have any workspaces.

01:22.860 --> 01:25.080
So this section down here will be empty.

01:25.230 --> 01:30.300
So suppose I want to load a workspace, I can open a workspace and navigate to it, or I'm just going

01:30.300 --> 01:35.280
to click Workspace two right here, which is a workspace that I created with several projects in it

01:35.280 --> 01:37.080
just to walk you through this interface.

01:37.080 --> 01:43.170
So I'm just going to double click that and you can see that Code Light has loaded Workspace two into

01:43.170 --> 01:44.340
the workspace view.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.740
Workspace two has four projects in it.

01:46.740 --> 01:48.990
Project one, project two, three and four.

01:48.990 --> 01:52.680
Each one of those is a standalone C plus plus application.

01:52.680 --> 01:59.280
We can expand each of them and you can see each one has a source folder and within the source folder

01:59.280 --> 02:02.370
they each have a Main.cpp source file.

02:02.370 --> 02:04.650
That's where our C plus plus code goes.

02:04.800 --> 02:09.450
Later in the course, we're going to have projects that have multiple CP files in them.

02:10.230 --> 02:17.580
Also you can see that project one is bold and italicized that tells you that project one is the active

02:17.580 --> 02:18.360
project.

02:18.390 --> 02:23.010
The way that code light works is that it builds and runs the active project.

02:23.010 --> 02:27.900
So when we come up and build things in a minute, it's always going to build the active project.

02:27.900 --> 02:32.460
So it's really important that we understand what we're building because we could be editing Project

02:32.460 --> 02:36.480
four and then pressing build thinking that Project four is being built.

02:36.480 --> 02:40.590
But if Project One is the active project, project one will be built.

02:40.780 --> 02:45.120
It sounds confusing, but it really isn't just make active what you're working on.

02:45.120 --> 02:46.680
It's really, really straightforward.

02:46.830 --> 02:49.800
Okay, so that's the workspace view.

02:49.830 --> 02:54.330
We've got some tabs up here and the only one we're going to use is workspace.

02:54.330 --> 02:55.440
Don't worry about the rest.

02:55.470 --> 03:02.040
An IDE or an integrated development environment such as Code Lite is designed for small programs like

03:02.040 --> 03:04.950
we're going to do, and it's also designed for very large programs.

03:04.950 --> 03:08.670
So it's got a lot of bells and whistles that we're not going to use.

03:08.700 --> 03:13.360
These are the kinds of things you would use in programs that are thousands of files and very, very

03:13.360 --> 03:14.070
complicated.

03:14.080 --> 03:16.750
So in this case, we're just going to keep it really, really simple.

03:16.750 --> 03:20.320
This is all about learning C plus plus more than it is about learning code lite.

03:20.530 --> 03:23.050
So there's my workspace.

03:23.050 --> 03:27.040
You can see that I have this little paper airplane here.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.320
And when you click that, it collapses everything.

03:29.320 --> 03:34.270
Sometimes we've got a lot of projects in here and they all get expanded and it's really hard to find

03:34.300 --> 03:34.810
stuff.

03:34.810 --> 03:37.330
So if you click that, it just collapses everything.

03:37.990 --> 03:40.270
Now I can expand whatever I like again.

03:41.020 --> 03:48.550
Also, if I'm somewhere down here, let's say, and I want to go to my active project, I can just click

03:48.550 --> 03:52.910
that home icon and that takes me to my active project right away and opens it up.

03:52.930 --> 03:54.130
So that's kind of handy.

03:54.130 --> 03:55.750
And you've already seen the settings.

03:55.750 --> 04:00.430
You can click the project you want and you can click that little wrench and it gives you your settings.

04:00.430 --> 04:04.360
We did that when we installed and configured code light a few videos ago.

04:04.660 --> 04:05.170
All right.

04:05.170 --> 04:07.300
So that's the workspace view.

04:07.330 --> 04:11.260
Now, this big area right here in the center that's got nothing in it right now.

04:11.260 --> 04:12.540
This is your editor.

04:12.580 --> 04:17.620
In order to use the editor, you need to click on a C plus plus file or something in the project.

04:17.620 --> 04:20.590
So in this case, I'm going to double click on main.cpp.

04:20.590 --> 04:26.050
And it opened it up and you can see this is very similar to the program we wrote during the installs.

04:26.050 --> 04:27.550
Hello from Project one.

04:27.850 --> 04:28.810
Makes sense.

04:28.810 --> 04:33.760
Now let's say I want to open up Project two and I want to open up that source file that loaded up as

04:33.760 --> 04:34.000
well.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.150
And it says Hello from Project two up here in the tab.

04:37.150 --> 04:39.080
We can tab between those two.

04:39.080 --> 04:44.780
And as I do that, you can see this blue bar over here in the Workspace view jumping to the appropriate

04:44.780 --> 04:46.250
file in the project.

04:46.280 --> 04:50.000
We can turn that off by clicking that little link right here.

04:50.180 --> 04:51.740
I don't know why you would want to do that.

04:51.740 --> 04:55.820
I love the fact that I can see exactly where it's at, so I'm just going to leave that alone.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.460
We can open up the rest of these projects as well.

04:58.460 --> 05:02.240
Let me expand all of these and I'll open up Project three and Project four.

05:02.240 --> 05:08.750
So now you can see that I've got four project Main.cpp open up here and it's pretty easy to see which

05:08.750 --> 05:13.010
project they belong to and you can actually hover over it and it tells you the path to the workspace

05:13.010 --> 05:15.860
and the project and the file within the project.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.200
Okay, so that's great.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.850
When I modify the code and again, I'm going to go.

05:20.870 --> 05:26.180
Let me collapse all of these and I'm going to go to my active project and there's Project One.

05:26.180 --> 05:28.460
So that's where I'm at right now.

05:28.550 --> 05:31.250
I can close these up now just to get them out of the way.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.140
Right now I'm working on Project One.

05:33.530 --> 05:35.990
When I make any changes to this file.

05:35.990 --> 05:38.810
For example, suppose I added a space at the end of this line.

05:40.000 --> 05:45.730
We get this little red dot right there, right next to the project name in the tab that tells you that

05:45.730 --> 05:47.060
this file is called dirty.

05:47.080 --> 05:52.420
So in other words, what I'm working on right now is not what is on the file system.

05:52.420 --> 05:58.570
So it's telling you right there, hey, be sure to save this if you really want this updated on the

05:58.570 --> 06:06.850
disk so we can save with file, save file or Ctrl s, or you can click on this little save icon right

06:06.850 --> 06:07.900
up here on the bar.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.000
And I'll talk more about that control bar in a moment.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.290
So I can do that.

06:11.290 --> 06:14.610
I can press Ctrl s and that little red dot goes away.

06:14.620 --> 06:15.790
If you're on Linux.

06:15.790 --> 06:20.080
It's a little black dot on most Linux distributions, but again, it doesn't matter what color it is,

06:20.080 --> 06:22.090
but you're not going to see that little extra close.

06:22.540 --> 06:25.000
So that's my project one.

06:25.570 --> 06:27.490
Let me remove that line.

06:27.490 --> 06:30.730
And again, you can see that that's red and I'm going to save it again.

06:30.730 --> 06:33.820
So this is how we would edit our program.

06:33.820 --> 06:38.560
I've made this font large so that you can see it better on video.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.480
All of that is in the settings, colors and fonts.

06:41.480 --> 06:46.160
If you click that, you can change the fonts, the colors, the theme that you're using, whether it's

06:46.160 --> 06:50.420
a light theme or a dark theme and so forth, I'm just going to leave this alone.

06:51.020 --> 06:53.150
We've already learned how to create projects.

06:53.150 --> 06:55.190
We've learned how to create workspaces.

06:55.190 --> 06:56.960
We did that in the installation video.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.270
So that process is exactly the same.

06:59.270 --> 07:01.200
Now how do we build and run?

07:01.220 --> 07:04.040
Well, let me expand this right now.

07:04.040 --> 07:09.290
Project one is the active project so we can come up to build and we've got a couple of options here.

07:09.290 --> 07:13.850
You can see we can run, we can build the project, we can rebuild it, we can clean it, we can do

07:13.850 --> 07:15.320
a whole bunch of stuff, right?

07:15.350 --> 07:19.640
We're only going to be using a couple of these, actually, probably just one of these most of the time

07:20.090 --> 07:25.220
in order to create an executable file that we can run, we need to build the project.

07:25.220 --> 07:29.660
And in order to run an executable file, we have to have a good build.

07:29.660 --> 07:31.910
No syntax errors, no other errors.

07:31.910 --> 07:35.000
We can do that by pressing F7 to build the project.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.200
So let me do that.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.600
And the output view opens up down here.

07:38.600 --> 07:42.560
And I'm just going to scroll this up just a little bit, move it up so you can see it all.

07:42.590 --> 07:47.180
The output view opens up and we get our build output here.

07:47.180 --> 07:50.030
You can see that build output is in this build tab.

07:50.780 --> 07:55.130
If you post on the Q&amp;A forum saying, hey, I've got some kind of error, it's not building, I'm going

07:55.130 --> 07:58.490
to ask you to show me the build output because that tells me what's going on.

07:58.730 --> 08:00.950
So this is the build output notice.

08:00.950 --> 08:02.640
Successful build, no errors.

08:02.660 --> 08:06.680
Once we have a successful build, we can come up to build and run it.

08:06.680 --> 08:10.310
Now it's going to ask me, Would you like to build the active project before executing it?

08:10.310 --> 08:12.880
I've already built it so I don't have to build it again.

08:12.890 --> 08:14.060
You certainly could.

08:14.060 --> 08:19.400
And if you want to always do one of these, just remember your choice and click that little check mark

08:19.400 --> 08:22.280
and it's not going to pester you all the time with this little pop up.

08:22.280 --> 08:23.540
So let me execute it.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.100
Building and Running Project one.

08:25.100 --> 08:31.460
So I expect hello from Project one to display on my terminal, my command prompt execute.

08:32.560 --> 08:33.340
And there you go.

08:33.370 --> 08:34.810
Hello from Project One.

08:34.930 --> 08:40.360
I should also mention that the process for Mac Linux and Windows is exactly the same.

08:40.360 --> 08:44.280
So everything I'm talking about in this video applies to all of the operating systems.

08:44.290 --> 08:47.500
When we're done, we press enter and we close that.

08:47.710 --> 08:48.700
So that's that.

08:48.700 --> 08:52.860
Now we can modify the look and feel of.

08:52.870 --> 08:56.200
So for example, suppose I don't want my output view over here.

08:56.200 --> 09:00.600
Suppose I want my output view over here on the right, I can grab this blue bar.

09:00.610 --> 09:04.510
It may not be blue on your end, but I can grab that bar and just drag it over here.

09:04.510 --> 09:07.540
You can see it's lighting up right there, so I'm just going to drop it there.

09:07.540 --> 09:09.250
So there's my output view.

09:09.460 --> 09:15.280
And now suppose I want my workspace view to be above that so I can just move that over there.

09:15.280 --> 09:18.880
So now I can have my workspace view over here, my output view over here.

09:19.120 --> 09:23.440
The view menu option gives you all kinds of options.

09:23.530 --> 09:28.360
For example, I can turn my output pane off, in which case you can see it's just disappeared over here

09:28.360 --> 09:31.090
from the right and I can turn it back on.

09:31.480 --> 09:35.480
I can turn my workspace pane off and back on.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.260
This is totally up to you what your preferences are.

09:39.290 --> 09:42.650
As far as the look and feel of your work environment.

09:42.860 --> 09:46.790
We can also do a view with the main toolbar orientation.

09:46.790 --> 09:47.960
That's the toolbar.

09:47.960 --> 09:52.400
That's this toolbar right up there, the one we see with the plus and the bug and all that.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.590
These are just shortcuts to things I've been doing.

09:54.590 --> 09:58.190
We can add a new file, we can open a file, we can save a file.

09:58.190 --> 10:01.910
That little hammer builds the active project here.

10:01.910 --> 10:06.290
We can stop a build, which is not a big deal for us because our builds are pretty fast.

10:06.290 --> 10:08.580
But when we have really, really large.

10:08.600 --> 10:13.280
C plus plus programs builds can sometimes take an hour, believe it or not, or longer.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.380
So sometimes we want to stop the build.

10:15.380 --> 10:16.580
For whatever reason.

10:16.820 --> 10:18.680
We can clean the active project.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.600
And I'll show you what that is in just a moment.

10:20.600 --> 10:25.250
And we can run the active project and certainly we can debug and we'll talk about debugging in a different

10:25.250 --> 10:25.890
video.

10:25.910 --> 10:28.640
So these are the main functions here.

10:29.030 --> 10:34.580
If for whatever reason you just get lost in this interface, you start moving these things around and

10:34.580 --> 10:35.990
oh my goodness, I don't like what I've done.

10:35.990 --> 10:42.620
And if having trouble getting back, you can always just go to view and restore layout and that'll bring

10:42.620 --> 10:45.110
it right back to factory default basically.

10:45.320 --> 10:48.410
So as I said, there's all the view issues here.

10:48.410 --> 10:52.670
If you don't like that main toolbar up here at the top and you want it on the left, you can just go

10:52.670 --> 10:57.740
to view main toolbar orientation left and then it's going to say, Do you want to reload code light?

10:57.830 --> 10:59.930
Sometimes it's going to want to restart.

10:59.940 --> 11:01.670
So let's say yes, you can see what it's like.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.100
It closes up, it opens up again.

11:04.100 --> 11:07.100
And now you can see that the toolbar is over here on the left.

11:07.100 --> 11:11.030
So again, personal preference is there all the way around with the views.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.580
So now let's talk about the build again.

11:14.000 --> 11:22.760
In this case, if I want to build, what that means is I want to build the active project.

11:23.090 --> 11:24.640
So what code light is going to do?

11:24.650 --> 11:29.000
It's going to go out there and it's going to see first, has it already been built?

11:29.240 --> 11:35.630
If it has been built, then it's going to say, has anything changed in the source code here since the

11:35.630 --> 11:36.620
last build?

11:36.740 --> 11:39.170
If the answer is no, then it's not going to rebuild it.

11:39.170 --> 11:42.320
It doesn't need to rebuild it since the build is current.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.430
Makes sense.

11:43.460 --> 11:48.710
Now if we have made any changes or it's the first time we build, it's going to certainly build it.

11:48.710 --> 11:50.150
So that's what Build does.

11:50.180 --> 11:50.690
Clean.

11:50.690 --> 11:57.170
The project removes any intermediate files, the executables, it just basically clears out everything.

11:57.170 --> 12:00.560
Not your source code, just the build products cleans out everything.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.140
So the next time we build, we have a clean build.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.270
In other words, there's nothing pre built.

12:05.810 --> 12:06.710
Rebuild.

12:06.710 --> 12:08.280
Does both of those essentially.

12:08.300 --> 12:10.530
First, it cleans and then it builds.

12:10.550 --> 12:14.690
That's what I would encourage you to use throughout the course Rebuild project.

12:14.720 --> 12:20.600
The reason that we don't use rebuild project in industry very much is because our projects can be very,

12:20.600 --> 12:21.530
very large.

12:21.530 --> 12:27.980
And if I do a clean and then a build every time, it could take 20 30 minutes, whereas the build itself

12:27.980 --> 12:30.950
is only going to build things that have changed since the last build.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.390
So they're much more efficient.

12:32.390 --> 12:35.570
But for this course I would encourage you to select Rebuild Project.

12:35.570 --> 12:36.320
So let me do that.

12:36.320 --> 12:41.480
I'm going to click Rebuild Project and you can see that the output view opened up down here.

12:41.660 --> 12:47.510
You probably didn't see it, but right before the build happened, the clean also happened and the clean

12:47.510 --> 12:48.380
kind of looks like this.

12:48.380 --> 12:52.790
I'm going to select Build clean project and you can see that means remove.

12:52.820 --> 12:58.310
So it's removing all the files in the build debug folder, which are all the intermediate files, all

12:58.310 --> 12:59.840
the binary files essentially.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.830
So that's the clean.

13:01.850 --> 13:03.770
Now we can come up to build again.

13:03.770 --> 13:05.970
Now remember, let me rebuild it.

13:06.210 --> 13:11.250
Now when you see a build that includes G plus plus X, that's a real build.

13:11.250 --> 13:14.870
That's actually building the intermediate files.

13:14.880 --> 13:15.090
Okay.

13:15.090 --> 13:16.290
I hope this makes sense.

13:16.320 --> 13:20.730
Now, if I try to build again just to build notice, nothing happened.

13:20.730 --> 13:22.920
There was no G plus plus command in there.

13:22.950 --> 13:25.020
That's because the project was already built.

13:25.050 --> 13:27.210
Code light realized I don't need to build it.

13:27.210 --> 13:28.290
It's already current.

13:28.470 --> 13:31.290
So my advice is to always use rebuild.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.490
Okay, now we can do it at the project level, the active project.

13:35.490 --> 13:40.710
Or we can build the entire workspace or clean an entire workspace or rebuild an entire workspace.

13:40.710 --> 13:43.350
So let me show you how to clean the entire workspace.

13:44.480 --> 13:47.270
You can see that I just cleaned the workspace.

13:47.270 --> 13:51.590
So it's removing files from every single project.

13:51.590 --> 13:52.700
So you can see Project four.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.800
Project two, Project three, Project one.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.990
Now I can rebuild each project.

13:57.870 --> 14:04.710
I'm going to rebuild the workspace and it's going to build everything for each project within the workspace.

14:04.740 --> 14:06.390
We're probably not going to use that.

14:06.390 --> 14:08.250
I just wanted to show you that it was there.

14:09.450 --> 14:10.680
Okay, perfect.

14:10.710 --> 14:16.680
Now, obviously I can run Project one again if I make project for the active project and I can do that

14:16.680 --> 14:22.320
by just double clicking it just like that and I can run it and go to build and run.

14:22.980 --> 14:27.720
I don't need to build it Since I've built everything in the workspace already, I'll just execute and

14:27.720 --> 14:31.230
we should see Hello from Project four and that's exactly what we see.

14:31.800 --> 14:32.550
Great.

14:32.580 --> 14:32.880
All right.

14:32.880 --> 14:38.130
So that covers the building, the debugger I'll cover in a separate video later on in the class.

14:38.370 --> 14:41.340
Let me close this output view down a little bit.

14:41.370 --> 14:47.220
We also have searching, for example, I could search for things within files, across files.

14:47.220 --> 14:53.070
I know that all these programs have a main in it so I can find in files and I can say I want to search

14:53.070 --> 14:53.880
for Main.

14:54.700 --> 14:56.020
And press find.

14:56.020 --> 15:01.510
And then the output view again opens up, this time with the search tab highlighted.

15:01.510 --> 15:06.760
And you can see that I've got a main in Project one and Project two and project three and so forth.

15:06.760 --> 15:12.460
And if I want to go to, let's say, Project Ones main, I could just find Project one and click here.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.330
And there it is.

15:14.330 --> 15:19.580
Project Once Main, I can go to Project Two's main and Project two opens up up here and there.

15:19.580 --> 15:25.370
It's been so it's pretty handy to find things across files in your entire workspace in this case.

15:26.450 --> 15:29.960
We can clear all this by just clicking right there.

15:29.990 --> 15:31.790
That little broom and clear it up.

15:32.530 --> 15:34.110
And that's my output view.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.820
It's got several uses.

15:35.830 --> 15:40.630
This build tab is probably the one we're going to use the most and it's probably the most important

15:40.630 --> 15:44.050
one because that'll tell us if there's compiler errors and so forth.

15:44.260 --> 15:44.560
All right.

15:44.560 --> 15:46.120
So let me close this back up.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.930
Now the plug ins.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.700
Let's talk about that for a moment.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.130
There's really two plug ins I want you to activate.

15:54.130 --> 15:55.630
They may be activated already.

15:55.630 --> 15:56.260
They may not be.

15:56.260 --> 15:57.450
But let me show you how to do it.

15:57.460 --> 16:00.550
You go to plug ins and manage plug ins.

16:00.550 --> 16:03.760
And let me close this down here to give us a little bit more room.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.430
Let's go to plug ins, manage plug ins.

16:06.580 --> 16:08.290
And there's a whole bunch of plug ins.

16:08.290 --> 16:13.600
And plug ins are just little external pieces of code and little programs that code like uses.

16:13.600 --> 16:19.150
So the ones that I want you to check off for sure are language server, plug in, make sure that's checked.

16:19.150 --> 16:23.110
And down here where it says wizards, make sure that's checked because we're going to use that later

16:23.110 --> 16:24.040
in the course.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.670
That's it.

16:25.850 --> 16:26.120
Hit.

16:26.120 --> 16:26.840
Okay.

16:27.110 --> 16:33.200
And when you come to plug ins, it might ask you to restart, but you'll see those two plug ins here

16:33.290 --> 16:35.150
and the language server.

16:35.180 --> 16:38.630
You can basically go to settings and make sure that everything is enabled.

16:38.630 --> 16:44.150
It should be by default and then you could restart the language server.

16:45.140 --> 16:48.110
And what that does is that helps you do code completion.

16:48.110 --> 16:51.760
So as I type, it's going to help me by helping me complete the code.

16:51.770 --> 16:56.810
For example, if I typed in some variable name here and again, we'll talk all about variable names

16:56.810 --> 16:57.440
later.

16:57.590 --> 16:59.600
Let's create an integer called age.

16:59.600 --> 17:05.020
Let's say my age, something like that, and put a semicolon here.

17:05.030 --> 17:10.430
Then later on, if I want to use my age, I can just type my underscore and it pops it up for me and

17:10.430 --> 17:13.550
I can just press tab and use it so I don't have to type.

17:13.580 --> 17:17.000
It also allows us let me delete this.

17:17.030 --> 17:20.690
It also allows us to use some of the C plus plus keywords and functions.

17:20.690 --> 17:26.660
So for example, if I wanted to use a double, I could just do that press tab and create a variable

17:26.660 --> 17:27.050
name.

17:27.050 --> 17:30.050
So again, it makes it very, very handy.

17:30.170 --> 17:32.120
It's kind of finicky sometimes.

17:32.120 --> 17:35.230
Sometimes it wants to work, sometimes it doesn't want to work.

17:35.240 --> 17:38.930
What I've found is if it doesn't work, just rebuild.

17:39.140 --> 17:39.950
Rebuild.

17:39.950 --> 17:42.050
And then it kind of kicks it in.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.600
So that's the plug ins, the settings.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.040
There's tons of settings here.

17:47.040 --> 17:50.280
We've already seen some of the colors and fonts, the preferences.

17:50.790 --> 17:55.420
We've got whether we want to display line numbers over here in the editor or not.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.740
We can turn that on and off, highlight the current line number like that.

17:58.740 --> 18:00.450
You can see seven is bold.

18:00.810 --> 18:06.600
Again, I just leave all this alone because the default settings are pretty good.

18:07.200 --> 18:07.740
Close that up.

18:07.740 --> 18:08.610
You can look through there.

18:08.610 --> 18:13.680
But again, don't just start clicking on things because your interface is going to get pretty crazy.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.270
So let me just leave that alone.

18:15.300 --> 18:19.410
Then the other thing you're going to see in your code is this little red thing, and it might be red

18:19.410 --> 18:23.640
or it might not be red depending on the operating system, but you'll see some kind of little icon here

18:23.640 --> 18:27.810
where we can click it and it collapses that.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.710
So you can see that it collapses that.

18:30.720 --> 18:34.780
Now that doesn't look very useful here, but when you've got a lot of code, let's say you have five,

18:34.800 --> 18:40.110
600 lines of code and you've got parts of your program that you're really not interested in right now,

18:40.140 --> 18:41.820
you're working on a different section.

18:41.820 --> 18:47.340
You can collapse certain sections to kind of just hide them, sort of it's not really hiding them because

18:47.340 --> 18:51.700
they're there, but just kind of get them out of my way right now while I work on this other section.

18:51.700 --> 18:52.990
The code is still there.

18:52.990 --> 18:57.910
You can see from the dots that the code is still there and we can always expand it whenever we like.

18:59.130 --> 18:59.520
Okay.

18:59.520 --> 19:02.830
So pretty much covers the basics that I wanted to cover.

19:02.850 --> 19:03.750
Really important.

19:03.780 --> 19:06.450
Don't forget about view restore layout.

19:06.450 --> 19:12.740
If your layout gets really wonky, just go back to view and restore your layout and you're good to go.

19:12.750 --> 19:17.730
As far as creating workspaces and creating projects, we've already done that before in the installation

19:17.730 --> 19:20.160
videos, so that should be pretty straightforward.

19:20.190 --> 19:26.310
If you have a workspace open and you try to create a new one, it won't let you make sure you close

19:26.310 --> 19:29.820
the workspace first and then you're allowed to create one.

19:29.820 --> 19:32.460
So here's a Section 19 workspace.

19:32.460 --> 19:34.690
This is a workspace we're going to use later in the course.

19:34.710 --> 19:40.020
Let me open it up to give you an example of a workspace with a bunch of projects in it.

19:40.020 --> 19:41.790
So you can see Section 19.

19:41.790 --> 19:43.170
That's again later on in the course.

19:43.170 --> 19:47.790
This is the section we're going to use, and this is the section on i o on how to use files and how

19:47.790 --> 19:48.930
to do things like that.

19:48.930 --> 19:52.050
So we've got a lot of different projects in here.

19:52.230 --> 19:58.050
Each one has a description main.cpp and this is some of the code that we'll write later on.

19:58.350 --> 20:02.950
I know it looks maybe a little bit daunting right now, but don't worry, it'll be fine.

20:03.190 --> 20:04.420
I can close that up.

20:04.420 --> 20:05.890
And in this case, challenge.

20:05.890 --> 20:08.800
One solution is the default project.

20:08.830 --> 20:09.970
Here is the challenge.

20:09.970 --> 20:12.670
One solution solution.

20:12.880 --> 20:19.990
So there's the code and you can see here where it really is useful to use code folding and fold some

20:19.990 --> 20:22.440
of this stuff and kind of get it out of the way.

20:22.450 --> 20:25.300
So for example, there's my main that's my whole program, right?

20:25.300 --> 20:29.590
But let's say I only want to look at structs and I'm only looking at my structure.

20:29.590 --> 20:34.960
So they show up really, really cleanly without going through hundreds and hundreds of lines of code.

20:35.350 --> 20:37.120
In this case, that's my challenge.

20:37.120 --> 20:40.300
One solution Suppose I want to run it well, I'm going to come to build.

20:40.300 --> 20:44.200
Remember, it is the active project because it's bold and italicized.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.430
I'm going to go to build.

20:45.430 --> 20:47.410
I'm going to select Rebuild Project.

20:47.710 --> 20:49.750
You can see my output view down here.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.760
It's doing G plus plus X.

20:51.790 --> 20:54.400
It's using everything I need to use.

20:54.430 --> 20:58.270
Then I'm going to come to build run project right there.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.150
Just execute.

21:00.810 --> 21:04.920
I'm going to get a command prompt window, and that's the output from this program that we're going

21:04.920 --> 21:06.480
to do later on in the course.

21:08.150 --> 21:09.630
Okay, so that's it.

21:09.650 --> 21:13.130
This gives you a pretty good feeling for the interface.

21:13.130 --> 21:14.720
The entire code, light interface.

21:14.720 --> 21:18.770
There's a lot of stuff I didn't cover, obviously, but I'm not going to use any of that stuff that

21:18.770 --> 21:20.270
I didn't cover in the course.

21:20.660 --> 21:26.810
IDs, as I said, are usually used for very large programs, but they can also be used for small programs.

21:26.810 --> 21:28.940
We're just not going to use all the bells and whistles.

21:28.940 --> 21:33.950
So you have any questions, please let me know and I'll see you in the next video and we'll start coding.
