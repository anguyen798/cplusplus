WEBVTT

00:05.190 --> 00:11.460
Now that we've downloaded and installed the command line tools and the C++ compiler, we'll now install

00:11.460 --> 00:14.580
the code light ID code.

00:14.580 --> 00:18.960
LT is an integrated development environment that's cross-platform open source.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.840
It runs on Mac OS ten Linux and Windows.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.930
In this video we're going to install it on Mac OS ten.

00:24.930 --> 00:28.590
So open up your favorite browser and go to code light dot org.

00:28.590 --> 00:31.860
That's code L dot org.

00:32.310 --> 00:34.200
And you'll see a web page similar to this.

00:34.200 --> 00:37.800
You want to find the download link, you can see one here at the top bar menu.

00:37.800 --> 00:40.890
And there's also this big blue button, which is the one I'm going to click on.

00:42.390 --> 00:47.520
I'll select that and you takes you to a page where you can contribute to the developers if you wish,

00:47.520 --> 00:50.340
or you could just go straight to the downloads and I'll do that.

00:50.340 --> 00:53.070
So I'll select right here, not now, take me to the download.

00:55.320 --> 01:00.000
Now here we've got some options we can install for Windows, for Mac, for Linux and so forth.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.070
We're interested in Mac in this example.

01:02.070 --> 01:07.200
So the third one down says Code Light 11.0 app bundle for OS ten.

01:07.200 --> 01:11.880
That's the one I want and I'm going to select the direct link to begin the download.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.950
The file is not very large, but the download is quite slow from this site.

01:20.940 --> 01:22.890
I'll pause the video while the download occurs.

01:23.130 --> 01:28.410
Once the download is complete, you can see that it's downloaded a compressed archive file.

01:28.410 --> 01:30.570
So what I'll do is I'll open that.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.190
And I'll double click on it to, um, compress it.

01:40.280 --> 01:45.050
There's my code light app, which I just drag to my applications folder.

01:46.040 --> 01:46.670
That's it.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.440
Code lights now on our system.

01:49.460 --> 01:55.400
In the next video, we'll run code light and configure it to use C++ compilers on MAC OS ten.
