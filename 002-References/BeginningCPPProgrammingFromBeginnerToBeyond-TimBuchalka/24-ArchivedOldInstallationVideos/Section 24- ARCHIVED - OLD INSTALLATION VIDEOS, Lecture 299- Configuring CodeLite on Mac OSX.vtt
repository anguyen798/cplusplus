WEBVTT

00:04.940 --> 00:08.960
In this video, we'll run and configure code light on Mac OS ten.

00:09.050 --> 00:12.640
Now we've already installed the compiler tools and we've installed code light.

00:12.650 --> 00:19.040
So let's run code light, we'll come up to spotlight, search and type code light and double click on

00:19.040 --> 00:19.820
the icon.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.600
We'll allow it to run.

00:32.360 --> 00:35.560
Now the first time that code light runs, a couple of things will happen.

00:35.570 --> 00:39.800
You'll get this small code light window show up and then you'll get a setup wizard.

00:40.970 --> 00:42.740
We can just leave that window smallest.

00:42.770 --> 00:44.120
We'll make it larger in a minute.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.830
It's not really going to get in our way right now.

00:45.850 --> 00:48.170
It's important is that we run this setup wizard.

00:48.320 --> 00:56.270
If the setup wizard does not start, come up to code lights menu and go up to help and then run the

00:56.270 --> 00:58.760
setup wizard and run it manually.

00:59.390 --> 01:01.100
But here in this case, it did pop up.

01:01.100 --> 01:02.600
So let's select next.

01:05.780 --> 01:11.480
Code Light uses a bunch of plug ins to allow support for PHP and Node and other technologies.

01:11.480 --> 01:12.680
We don't really want all that.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.930
We only want the C++ plug ins.

01:15.020 --> 01:17.300
The rest are just going to clutter up our interface.

01:17.300 --> 01:23.720
So what we can do here is we can press clear and then just toggle the C++ plugins that way.

01:23.720 --> 01:27.020
Only some of these will show up, which is exactly what we want.

01:27.020 --> 01:30.800
We just want to concentrate on C++, Select next.

01:32.270 --> 01:35.510
Now we can scan our computer for any installed compilers.

01:35.510 --> 01:42.920
We can press this button here and you can see it's found DCC Clang and across DCC we're going to use

01:42.920 --> 01:43.790
GCC.

01:43.820 --> 01:48.440
They're really the same, but we'll use GCC here and press next.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.950
Now the customization of the theme is really up to you.

01:51.950 --> 01:53.480
This is your personal preference.

01:53.480 --> 01:59.210
The monarchy dark theme is real nice and easy on the eyes, but it doesn't show up too well on video.

01:59.210 --> 02:04.280
So I'm going to select the classic Eclipse theme and select next.

02:05.030 --> 02:07.730
We'll keep these defaults and press finish.

02:09.740 --> 02:13.130
Now, what we can do here is we can say save and exit.

02:13.130 --> 02:16.490
You want to be sure that you save so we can save the changes we've made

02:19.850 --> 02:21.710
and we can run code light again.

02:31.070 --> 02:33.230
So this time I want to make this window nice and big

02:35.870 --> 02:38.690
and we've got a couple of options that we still need to configure.

02:38.690 --> 02:41.240
But before we do that, we need to create a workspace.

02:41.900 --> 02:49.460
You can create a workspace by clicking this button here or by coming up to file new workspace.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.990
Either place works fine.

02:51.140 --> 02:57.230
A workplace is just an area where we can have our C++ projects, so we can have multiple projects in

02:57.230 --> 02:58.040
a workspace.

02:58.040 --> 03:03.200
So I'm going to select new workspace, and the workspace name could be anything you like.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.720
I'm going to say keep workspace.

03:07.340 --> 03:10.040
Don't use any spaces here, just keep it all together.

03:10.490 --> 03:15.650
And I want to create the workspace under a separate directory so I can keep my files organized.

03:15.680 --> 03:16.760
I'll select, okay.

03:17.570 --> 03:20.930
And you can see that it's created the workspace over here on the left pane.

03:21.440 --> 03:30.020
Now we need to create a C++ project so you can right click on that and select new project, or you can

03:30.020 --> 03:33.620
select the workspace and then come up to file new project.

03:33.620 --> 03:38.150
Either way, now we've got some options.

03:38.510 --> 03:46.160
We're going to create console project and simple executable G plus plus right here.

03:46.850 --> 03:53.450
And that's the compiler we're going to use and we'll select next the project name again.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.890
Don't use any spaces here.

03:54.890 --> 03:58.490
Just create your name, the name for your project, whatever you like.

03:59.420 --> 04:03.710
I'm again, I'm going to create a separate directory for each project and I'll select next.

04:06.050 --> 04:11.370
As far as the compiler, we want to use the GCC compiler, but the debugger, we don't want to use the

04:11.390 --> 04:14.300
new debugger, we want to use the LTB debugger.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.530
That's the Apple debugger.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.330
We'll select finish.

04:18.020 --> 04:22.550
And you can see over here on the left that we've created a project called Test one and it's got a source

04:22.550 --> 04:25.640
directory and it's got a file there called Main CP.

04:25.670 --> 04:29.840
Now before we run that file, there's a couple of things that we need to set up.

04:30.020 --> 04:37.430
First click on the project in this case, test one right click and then come down to settings and select

04:37.430 --> 04:37.910
that.

04:39.140 --> 04:45.680
Then down here toward the bottom where you see global settings come up to compiler options and select

04:45.680 --> 04:46.760
the right side.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.520
And then you'll see this little button right here with the three dots.

04:49.520 --> 04:50.480
Select that.

04:51.350 --> 04:54.620
And what we want to do here is we want to check a couple of options.

04:54.840 --> 05:01.250
We scroll all the way up and I want to select enable all compiler warnings wall and I want to enable

05:01.280 --> 05:03.200
C++ 14 features.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.460
That's the latest standard.

05:04.460 --> 05:06.050
That's modern C++.

05:06.050 --> 05:11.540
I want to make sure that that's enabled and this guy doesn't come on, but you can see that it is there

05:11.540 --> 05:13.550
something sometimes it doesn't check on.

05:13.970 --> 05:15.680
You can see that the command line is correct.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.610
So just click.

05:16.610 --> 05:19.460
Okay, I'll apply and click.

05:19.460 --> 05:20.690
Okay, perfect.

05:20.690 --> 05:27.380
Now go to the workspace, select it right click on it and come down to workspace settings.

05:28.670 --> 05:35.450
And you'll see we have environment and code completion, select code completion and check the Enable

05:35.450 --> 05:37.400
C++ 14 standard.

05:38.390 --> 05:41.450
The Integrated Development Environments use code completion.

05:41.450 --> 05:45.350
They try to figure out what you're typing and what you want to do and where you want to go and really

05:45.350 --> 05:46.940
help you out with suggestions.

05:46.940 --> 05:51.710
In this case, we're simply telling code light to use the C++ 14 standard.

05:51.710 --> 05:54.350
For those suggestions, I'll click.

05:54.350 --> 05:57.140
Okay, and that's it for the setup.

05:57.470 --> 06:00.860
Now let's modify this C++ file and run it.

06:01.790 --> 06:03.260
Let's double click on that.

06:03.680 --> 06:06.440
And that font is really small.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.980
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to make it a little larger so it shows up better on the video.

06:09.980 --> 06:11.990
Most likely you won't have to touch it at all.

06:11.990 --> 06:20.390
But I'm just going to come to settings, colors and fonts, and I'll set the font to, let's say 18

06:23.210 --> 06:27.110
and I'll apply that and that should be much more readable.

06:27.890 --> 06:29.630
Okay, so now let's modify this file.

06:29.630 --> 06:31.820
This is actually C code, not C++ code.

06:31.820 --> 06:39.320
So let's get rid of all this and we'll type a simple C++ program that will test our installation during

06:39.320 --> 06:39.890
this course.

06:39.890 --> 06:45.230
I will go in detail through the anatomy of a C++ program, and everything that I'll be typing here will

06:45.230 --> 06:46.010
be explained.

06:46.010 --> 06:50.480
But for now, just follow along, type along to make sure we've got a clean install.

06:50.480 --> 06:57.230
So the first thing you want to do is going to type pound include and we want to put IO stream in angled

06:57.230 --> 07:04.190
brackets and press enter then int space main left and right paren.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.640
Then we want to open up a left curly and you can see that the IDE has closed it for me.

07:11.030 --> 07:17.150
And then what I want to do here is I just want to say STD two colon side by side, no spaces and then

07:17.150 --> 07:26.600
see out the insertion operator, which is two less than sines again together with no spaces and anything

07:26.600 --> 07:27.740
you want to type here as far as.

07:27.740 --> 07:29.690
Hello testing.

07:30.200 --> 07:35.300
We want to type a string inside double quotes and a semicolon at the end, and then next line will be

07:35.300 --> 07:35.720
returned.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.080
Zero.

07:36.110 --> 07:36.590
That's it.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.020
That's the entire program.

07:38.030 --> 07:43.900
When we run this program, what we want to do is we want to display hello testing to the console.

07:43.910 --> 07:45.140
That's all it's going to do.

07:45.350 --> 07:46.640
I'll save this

07:49.280 --> 07:57.800
under save file at this point on your end, you may want to do view, toggle, minimal view and that'll

07:57.800 --> 07:58.710
display.

07:58.760 --> 07:59.900
Let me do that again.

08:01.190 --> 08:04.700
That will display some buttons and things up here which you might find useful.

08:05.270 --> 08:11.180
I'm not going to do that because it clutters up the screen and I don't want any distractions when I'm

08:11.180 --> 08:11.960
teaching the class.

08:11.960 --> 08:13.970
So I'll toggle that away.

08:14.630 --> 08:19.070
And what I'll do is, rather than click on the buttons, I'll be really explicit as to let's click on

08:19.070 --> 08:21.620
Build, Run, Build, Clean, and so forth.

08:21.620 --> 08:23.720
That way you can see exactly what's going on.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.020
Once you get familiar with the ID, you can use those buttons.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.100
That's it.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.060
So I've saved it.

08:29.060 --> 08:30.590
Now I want to run this.

08:30.590 --> 08:35.630
First thing I want to do is I want to go to build and clean the project.

08:35.630 --> 08:40.910
When we clean a project, we're basically just wiping out everything that's been done in the past except

08:40.910 --> 08:41.750
the source code.

08:41.750 --> 08:47.390
So the project is in a state that's ready to go, so I'm just going to clean it and then I'm going to

08:47.390 --> 08:50.180
come back up to build and I'm going to say Run.

08:51.080 --> 08:55.730
Now it's going to give me an option that says, Would you like to build the active project before executing

08:55.730 --> 08:56.030
it?

08:56.060 --> 08:58.580
Of course I do, because I haven't built it yet in this case.

08:58.580 --> 09:04.370
So I'm going to select, build and execute and that will compile the program and open up a window.

09:04.370 --> 09:06.350
And there's the output right there.

09:06.350 --> 09:06.860
Hello?

09:06.860 --> 09:07.610
Testing.

09:08.420 --> 09:12.770
So this terminal window is running the program that I just wrote.

09:13.250 --> 09:13.940
That's it.

09:13.940 --> 09:15.200
It's a simple as that.

09:15.770 --> 09:17.360
Some things could go wrong, though.

09:17.360 --> 09:23.840
Suppose that you forgot the semicolon here and I'll save it.

09:23.840 --> 09:24.800
And then I'll do the same.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.920
I'll do run, build and execute.

09:28.340 --> 09:31.250
And you can see if I move this window just slightly up.

09:31.250 --> 09:35.000
You can see that I've got a compiler error and this is what compiler errors look like.

09:35.030 --> 09:39.980
You see the red text here and it says error expected a semicolon after an expression.

09:40.430 --> 09:44.600
Also you'll see that little red arrow right here telling you there's just something wrong here.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.140
And basically what you need to do is put a semicolon there.

09:48.380 --> 09:52.040
Just type the program really carefully, exactly like I did it.

09:52.040 --> 09:56.150
You won't have any problems, but you could have things missing like this quote.

09:56.480 --> 09:57.860
This first quote is missing.

09:57.860 --> 09:59.750
This you might have three less than signs.

09:59.750 --> 10:02.540
There's all kinds of little things that could go wrong with the program.

10:02.540 --> 10:10.010
But if you just be very careful, type it in, save it and come back up to build and run, build and

10:10.010 --> 10:10.460
execute.

10:10.460 --> 10:14.630
And you can click on there if you like that we don't have to keep doing it all the time.

10:15.650 --> 10:17.030
And there's the run.

10:17.660 --> 10:18.200
That's it.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.280
We're all set on Mac.

10:19.280 --> 10:24.590
We've installed the command line tools, we've installed code light, we've configured code light and

10:24.590 --> 10:25.640
we're good to go.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.040
Now let's start learning C++.
