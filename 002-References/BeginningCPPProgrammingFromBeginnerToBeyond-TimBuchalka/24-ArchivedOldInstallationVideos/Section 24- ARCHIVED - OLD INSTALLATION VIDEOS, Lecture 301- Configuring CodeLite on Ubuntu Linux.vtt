WEBVTT

00:05.330 --> 00:10.910
Now that code light is installed, we need to run it, configure it, and then run a little test program

00:10.910 --> 00:13.000
to make sure our configuration is correct.

00:13.010 --> 00:17.810
So the first thing we want to do is we want to find code light and you can just type code in the search

00:17.810 --> 00:20.180
and you'll find code light and double click.

00:22.130 --> 00:26.390
Now the first time it runs, you make it a small window like this and it's probably a good idea just

00:26.390 --> 00:27.650
to make it a little larger.

00:29.240 --> 00:33.590
Now, sometimes when you run it the first time, you'll get a setup wizard that runs.

00:33.590 --> 00:34.640
Sometimes you don't.

00:34.640 --> 00:41.060
We'd like to run the setup wizard, so if it doesn't show up, you can go to help run the setup wizard

00:41.060 --> 00:44.960
and select that and you get a window that pops up.

00:45.110 --> 00:46.640
So I'll select next.

00:47.660 --> 00:53.270
Now here, code light supports PHP and Node and a few other technologies.

00:53.270 --> 00:55.520
We really don't want all that clutter on our IDE.

00:55.550 --> 00:58.130
We want to strictly concentrate on C++.

00:58.130 --> 01:04.370
So I would suggest that we clear all the plug ins and then turn on only the C++ plug ins.

01:04.370 --> 01:10.160
So you can see now that not everything is checked, only the C++ plug ins are checked and we'll select

01:10.160 --> 01:10.790
next.

01:11.810 --> 01:15.350
Now we'll scan our computer for any installed compilers.

01:15.350 --> 01:19.520
So we'll scan the computer and it's found GCC and cross GCC.

01:19.520 --> 01:20.990
I'm going to select GCC.

01:21.020 --> 01:28.190
JC stands for the new compiler collection, which includes C, C++, Fortran, Ada and a few others

01:28.640 --> 01:29.840
I'll select next.

01:31.670 --> 01:35.360
As far as the editor theme, this is really a preference for you.

01:35.750 --> 01:40.580
This Dark Monaco theme is really easy on the eyes, but it doesn't show up too well on video.

01:40.580 --> 01:45.380
So I'm going to select the classic eclipse, look for the videos.

01:45.380 --> 01:47.090
You can choose whatever your preference is.

01:47.090 --> 01:48.170
Now press next.

01:49.550 --> 01:53.390
I'll leave these defaults as is and press finish.

01:57.110 --> 01:59.810
Now sometimes it opens up to windows like you see here.

01:59.810 --> 02:06.710
So I want to save an exit and I want to shut down all the versions that I've got going.

02:06.710 --> 02:10.670
I don't know why it does this, but it does it a few times and I'll save an exit again.

02:11.570 --> 02:13.460
All right, so now let's now we're back to normal.

02:13.460 --> 02:14.390
Let's try that again.

02:14.390 --> 02:15.740
So we'll run code light

02:19.010 --> 02:22.100
and let's make this full screen again.

02:22.550 --> 02:23.300
Perfect.

02:24.170 --> 02:26.960
So now what we need to do is we need to create a workspace.

02:26.990 --> 02:33.770
A workspace is an area where we can have our C++ projects, so we can have many C++ projects in one

02:33.770 --> 02:34.640
workspace.

02:34.640 --> 02:38.780
We can do that by selecting this button here called new workspace.

02:38.780 --> 02:44.360
Or we can go up to file new new workspace either place.

02:44.360 --> 02:48.830
So I'm going to select this button here and it's going to ask you for the workspace name.

02:48.830 --> 02:50.270
This can be any name you like.

02:50.300 --> 02:57.830
I'm going to say C.P Workspace and I'm going to put this on my desktop.

02:57.830 --> 03:00.440
You can store it anywhere you like as long as you remember where it's at.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.510
So I'm going to put this on my desktop.

03:07.040 --> 03:12.170
I want to create the workspace under a separate directory that'll help me organize my files better and

03:12.170 --> 03:12.440
press.

03:12.440 --> 03:14.690
Okay, that's it.

03:14.690 --> 03:17.930
Now we've got a workspace which you can see here on the left side.

03:18.140 --> 03:23.870
I can right click on that now and create a new project again.

03:23.870 --> 03:28.880
I can also go up file new project, so I'll do that.

03:29.660 --> 03:33.860
Now we've got some options here as to which template to use to create the project.

03:33.860 --> 03:40.130
We're going to stick to the console template, which is just basically a terminal window and we want

03:40.160 --> 03:41.030
G plus plus.

03:41.030 --> 03:42.920
That's the C plus plus compiler.

03:43.010 --> 03:46.700
It's called G Plus Plus because it's the new C++ compiler.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.260
I'll select next.

03:49.940 --> 03:51.590
What's my project name?

03:51.590 --> 03:53.120
It could be anything you like.

03:53.750 --> 03:55.940
Don't use spaces for any of these project names.

03:55.940 --> 03:57.290
So I'll just say test one.

03:59.660 --> 04:04.310
And again, I want to create a project in a separate directory under the workspace, so I'll select

04:04.310 --> 04:04.970
next.

04:06.110 --> 04:08.390
Now it's going to ask you which compiler do you want to use?

04:08.390 --> 04:10.850
You may have a lot of different compilers on your system.

04:11.240 --> 04:15.050
Just select the one that you used in the setup wizard and you'll be fine.

04:15.050 --> 04:17.090
And these defaults are perfectly fine.

04:17.090 --> 04:24.890
We'll select finish and that creates a test project under the CP workspace and you can see it's called

04:24.890 --> 04:31.490
it's created a source directory and in there it's got a main CP file that's our C++ source code and

04:31.490 --> 04:32.720
we'll get to that in a second.

04:33.590 --> 04:37.850
We need to do a couple of bits of configuration though before we do anything else.

04:38.600 --> 04:44.450
Let's go to our project test one in this case and we'll right click and we'll go down to the bottom

04:44.450 --> 04:49.850
where it says settings and we'll select that and then we'll go to where it says compiler options.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.180
And notice, I mean, the global settings, that's pretty important.

04:53.180 --> 04:58.070
I mean the global settings compiler options and then I'll select these three little dots here on the

04:58.070 --> 05:02.270
button and I want to make sure that w all is selected.

05:02.270 --> 05:03.650
That way we always get warning.

05:04.410 --> 05:09.590
And I want to make sure that the C++ standard, C++ 14 is selected.

05:09.600 --> 05:15.210
That's the latest standard for C++ that will make sure that we're using the modern C++ compiler.

05:15.870 --> 05:19.070
At that point, you can click Apply.

05:19.570 --> 05:21.960
Okay, good.

05:21.960 --> 05:29.910
Now we can go to our workspace and right click on that and come down to workspace settings and you'll

05:29.910 --> 05:31.980
see environment and code completion.

05:31.980 --> 05:36.060
Go to the code completion and select Enable C++ 14 Standard.

05:36.840 --> 05:42.570
The code completion is a tool that the Integrated Development Environment uses that tries to figure

05:42.570 --> 05:47.640
out what I'm typing and what I want to type, and it helps predict what I want to do so it can help

05:47.640 --> 05:51.120
me so I don't have to type so much and it can do some checking as it goes.

05:51.420 --> 05:56.010
In this case, I'm just telling you to use the modern C++ compiler I'll select.

05:56.010 --> 05:56.640
Okay.

05:57.960 --> 05:58.740
And that's it.

05:58.740 --> 06:00.960
Now we can run a simple test program.

06:00.960 --> 06:07.170
We'll double click the main CPP file, and this is actually C code, not C++ code.

06:07.170 --> 06:10.320
So we'll delete this in a minute, but that font is a little small.

06:10.320 --> 06:17.070
So in my case, since I'm doing this on video, I'm going to go to settings, colors and fonts, and

06:17.070 --> 06:19.290
I'm just going to set that to about 16.

06:21.870 --> 06:23.190
And let's see,

06:29.550 --> 06:30.330
that's much better.

06:30.330 --> 06:31.650
You should see that much better.

06:33.360 --> 06:41.160
So let's delete all of this and we'll write a really simple C++ program as we go through the course.

06:41.160 --> 06:46.140
I'll talk about the anatomy of a C++ program and we'll go into detail as to what everything I'm going

06:46.140 --> 06:47.310
to be typing here means.

06:47.310 --> 06:52.470
But for now, just type along and let's get a clean run so that we know our environments are set up.

06:52.470 --> 06:58.860
So the first thing we want to write is we want to write, pound, include and IO stream inside angle

06:58.860 --> 07:09.060
brackets, then we'll press enter, then we'll say int main and open and closed parens, then we'll

07:09.060 --> 07:15.150
create, then we'll type left curly and the integrated development environment will automatically close

07:15.150 --> 07:15.900
that for me.

07:16.770 --> 07:25.290
And here all I want to do is say STD to colons and see out then the insertion operator, which is two

07:25.290 --> 07:33.300
less than sines with no space in between and just some strings saying hello, testing or anything else

07:33.300 --> 07:33.840
you like.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.150
That has to be in double quotes.

07:36.450 --> 07:39.870
And then finally we'll put a semicolon on the end of that to terminate.

07:40.650 --> 07:43.770
And then finally the last statement will be returned zero.

07:44.010 --> 07:46.350
That means that the program terminated correctly.

07:46.350 --> 07:47.040
That's it.

07:47.040 --> 07:50.340
That's our first really simple C++ program.

07:50.340 --> 07:54.690
And like I said in the beginning of the course, I'll go through what all of this means and we'll go

07:54.690 --> 07:58.050
through the anatomy of a C++ program in great detail.

07:58.530 --> 07:59.670
I'll save this.

08:00.720 --> 08:06.720
Another option you may like is if you come up here to the menu and you say view and it will say Toggle

08:06.720 --> 08:10.920
minimal view and you can see it's putting a bunch of buttons up here.

08:10.920 --> 08:16.110
If you like this, this is great because you can run and compile and do all kinds of things just by

08:16.110 --> 08:17.160
clicking on a button.

08:17.400 --> 08:21.240
I'm not going to use that because I find that it's pretty distracting to the video.

08:21.240 --> 08:25.800
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to shut that off on my end, but feel free to use it.

08:25.950 --> 08:30.270
I'm going to use command keys and I'll also just come up here and say, build.

08:30.270 --> 08:33.750
And that way it's very explicit what I'm doing rather than just clicking on a button.

08:34.950 --> 08:35.700
So that's it.

08:35.700 --> 08:36.540
So let's run this.

08:36.540 --> 08:39.180
Now what I'll do is I'll say Build.

08:39.180 --> 08:41.640
First thing I want to do is I want to clean this project.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.130
That way there's no remnants of anything left over.

08:44.130 --> 08:45.870
It'll put it into a stable state.

08:45.870 --> 08:46.770
That's good to go.

08:46.770 --> 08:48.120
So I'll clean the project.

08:48.960 --> 08:49.410
All the.

08:49.410 --> 08:51.630
Any messages will show up down here.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.400
Then I'll say, build.

08:53.580 --> 08:54.660
Now I'll just say run.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.620
And it's going to ask me, do I just want to run it or do I want to build it and run it?

08:58.620 --> 09:01.650
Well, in this case, I have to build it and run it because I haven't built it yet.

09:01.650 --> 09:03.780
So I'll select, build and execute.

09:05.580 --> 09:11.370
And if all goes well, we'll get a window that pops up that says Hello, testing exactly what we typed

09:11.370 --> 09:11.850
here.

09:12.390 --> 09:13.710
Press any key to continue.

09:13.710 --> 09:15.120
Oh, sorry, press enter to continue.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.920
Which I'm going to press now.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.560
The window goes away and we're done now.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.450
Several things could go wrong here.

09:21.450 --> 09:23.400
You may have an error in your program.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.810
You might have forgotten to type this.

09:24.810 --> 09:25.950
Exactly right.

09:25.950 --> 09:31.080
So you may have forgotten the semicolon, in which case when you go to build and run,

09:35.430 --> 09:37.320
you'll see this red line here.

09:37.890 --> 09:39.330
That's a compiler error.

09:39.360 --> 09:44.250
You'll also see a red arrow over here telling you there's something wrong here and the compiler is telling

09:44.250 --> 09:47.340
you it's expecting a semicolon before the return.

09:47.520 --> 09:48.750
So put it in there.

09:49.440 --> 09:50.370
Just be really careful.

09:50.370 --> 09:55.860
I'll talk about debugging and fixing syntax errors throughout the entire course, but at this point,

09:56.130 --> 09:56.700
save it.

09:56.700 --> 09:57.750
Make sure it's right.

09:57.750 --> 09:58.980
Again, be very careful.

09:58.980 --> 10:01.770
You may have extra quote marks and the compiler won't like it.

10:01.770 --> 10:03.420
You might only have a single.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.220
Less than sign here and it's not going to like it.

10:06.220 --> 10:08.530
So just be sure it's exactly like this.

10:08.860 --> 10:14.320
Once you've got it set up, build, run, build and execute.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.950
There's a clean run and there's my terminal.

10:20.380 --> 10:21.030
So that's it.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.710
We're all set to learn C++.
