00:05.390 --> 00:10.190
In this video, we'll go over the steps necessary to create our own custom project template.

00:10.790 --> 00:15.470
The idea here is that we can create our own project templates, and when we create our projects, we

00:15.470 --> 00:17.630
can use this template as the starting point.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.590
That way we'll have a proper main CPP file.

00:21.620 --> 00:23.370
We'll have all our switches set.

00:23.390 --> 00:25.000
We'll have our environment set.

00:25.010 --> 00:26.160
All right, so let's get started.

00:26.180 --> 00:28.670
First thing you need to do is open up a workspace.

00:28.670 --> 00:32.120
I've got a workspace already open, already created, I should say.

00:32.120 --> 00:32.990
I'm going to open it now.

00:32.990 --> 00:34.460
I'm going to say open workspace.

00:34.460 --> 00:38.570
If you don't have a workspace at all, you could just say file new workspace.

00:38.660 --> 00:40.550
So I'll open the workspace that I've got.

00:40.550 --> 00:43.590
It's on my desktop and it's called CP workspace.

00:43.590 --> 00:44.630
So I'll open that.

00:46.250 --> 00:48.710
And the first thing you want to do is you want to add a project.

00:48.710 --> 00:53.810
So you want to right click on your workspace and say New, new project.

00:55.190 --> 00:59.180
Now here you've got the new project Wizard and you've got different examples.

00:59.180 --> 01:04.130
You can create gooey applications, console applications, you can have user templates and so forth.

01:04.130 --> 01:12.050
What we want to do is we want to use the simple executable plus plus template that comes with code light,

01:12.470 --> 01:14.030
and we want to tweak that our own way.

01:14.030 --> 01:18.320
And then what we want to do is we want to create our own template and here that we can choose and we

01:18.320 --> 01:22.310
could put it in console or we can put it here in user templates, we could put it wherever we'd like.

01:22.700 --> 01:22.910
Okay.

01:22.940 --> 01:25.070
But before we do that, we need to create a project.

01:25.070 --> 01:25.850
So let's do that.

01:25.850 --> 01:32.510
I'm going to select console and let's use the G plus plus simple executable console template press next.

01:34.040 --> 01:34.850
The project name.

01:34.850 --> 01:35.910
It doesn't really matter.

01:35.930 --> 01:42.290
I'll just say sample since we're going to save it as a template anyway and I'll select next.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.590
We want to make sure our compilers are set up correctly.

01:49.520 --> 01:53.660
Here I'm using min gw and the GDB debugger select finish.

01:54.870 --> 01:56.940
And that creates our project.

01:56.940 --> 02:01.770
You can see here's the source file and here's the CP file, which is really C code and not C++ code.

02:01.770 --> 02:03.120
But we'll fix all this in a minute.

02:03.210 --> 02:10.080
So first thing we want to do is we want to get rid of this and let's write a simple C++ program, same

02:10.080 --> 02:11.340
one we've been writing all along.

02:11.340 --> 02:18.180
So we'll say include IO stream, we'll include IO streams since we're going to probably use it in most

02:18.180 --> 02:22.350
of the projects that we write, then we have our main function.

02:24.490 --> 02:30.520
And again it's int main open closed friends and then an open curly which will be automatically closed

02:30.520 --> 02:30.940
by code.

02:30.940 --> 02:40.600
Like here we can indent in by just pressing tab and we could say STD two colons see out and then the

02:40.600 --> 02:47.770
insertion operator followed by the string hello world and you can type anything you like here for hello

02:47.770 --> 02:52.180
world and we'll do also an STD two colons and del.

02:52.420 --> 02:58.990
This prints a new line that way when we display hello world the cursor will go to the next line on the

02:58.990 --> 03:02.330
console and then finally we'll just return zero like we always do.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.040
That's it.

03:03.430 --> 03:06.820
I'm going to save this so that press control is here.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.350
So I've just done that and saved it.

03:09.250 --> 03:11.130
Now we'll set some compiler settings.

03:11.170 --> 03:14.290
We'll do this the one time, then we'll save it as a project template.

03:14.470 --> 03:21.160
So let's go to the sample project, the actual project name, and we'll right click go down to settings.

03:22.750 --> 03:27.190
Global settings and we want to make sure we've got those two compiler options set.

03:27.190 --> 03:29.620
So we're going to right click on those three little dots here on the button.

03:29.620 --> 03:34.990
You want to select that button and click, and we want to make sure that we've got our all warnings

03:34.990 --> 03:38.890
enabled on and our C++ 14 standard on.

03:39.850 --> 03:40.240
Press.

03:40.240 --> 03:40.810
Okay.

03:42.410 --> 03:50.060
Then you want to come to us as code completion and select that and select enable C++ 14 Standard Apply.

03:51.660 --> 03:52.560
And that's it.

03:52.770 --> 03:59.850
Now, what we can do is we can come to the project again, right click and say Save as template.

04:00.480 --> 04:01.620
So I'll select that.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.640
And what's the project name?

04:04.650 --> 04:05.940
This could be anything we want.

04:05.970 --> 04:13.770
We could just say frank template or template for course or any name you like rather than that.

04:13.770 --> 04:18.810
I'm just going to say Frank, let's see G plus.

04:18.810 --> 04:19.470
Plus.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.750
Console.

04:25.170 --> 04:25.680
Template.

04:25.680 --> 04:31.500
I think it's pretty picky about spaces, so I'm just going to use those dashes and it is a console application.

04:32.130 --> 04:34.980
If you leave it as console, it'll be in the console group.

04:35.100 --> 04:38.130
I'm actually going to change that to user template.

04:39.460 --> 04:41.410
And then you can give any description you want.

04:43.380 --> 04:45.390
I'll just say Frank's console template.

04:48.210 --> 04:48.780
That's it.

04:48.810 --> 04:49.290
I'll select.

04:49.290 --> 04:49.800
Okay.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.530
And now we've got a new template that's stored.

04:52.530 --> 04:58.320
So if I go back to my workspace and I want to create a new project now, we close all this up, I'm

04:58.320 --> 05:01.260
going to right click and say New project.

05:02.160 --> 05:07.080
And now you can go down to your templates and go down to your user templates right here.

05:07.650 --> 05:10.560
And you should see that one we just created right here.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.720
So we can just select that.

05:13.140 --> 05:22.350
Next, I'll just say project one, select next, keep the defaults for the compilers and finish.

05:23.220 --> 05:29.970
At this point you can double click here to make that project, the active project and we'll look at

05:29.970 --> 05:30.870
the main CP.

05:30.900 --> 05:33.570
You can see it's the main CP that we just typed.

05:34.320 --> 05:39.720
Also, if you right click on the project and you go down to the settings, you can see a code completion

05:39.720 --> 05:44.790
is C++ 14 and the global settings have the appropriate compiler flags that we need.

05:45.730 --> 05:46.540
That's it.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.010
We'll test this real quick.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.860
That's run, build and execute.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.050
And Hello World.

05:54.320 --> 05:54.770
That's it.

05:54.770 --> 05:56.590
So now you've got a project, you're all set up.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.560
You can create as many of these as you like.

05:58.580 --> 06:00.440
Tweak the settings as far as you like.

06:00.830 --> 06:04.280
It's really up to you to decide what you want to do with the project templates.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.650
But for this course include IO stream.

06:06.650 --> 06:07.810
Give yourself a main.

06:07.820 --> 06:11.450
You may or may not want this line right here since you know you're probably going to get rid of it anyway

06:11.450 --> 06:12.800
when we start writing other code.

06:12.800 --> 06:16.040
But at a minimum do something like that.

06:16.490 --> 06:19.220
When you create a new project, you'll be ready to start coding.
