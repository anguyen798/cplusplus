This video will go over the steps necessary to download and install the CodeLite integrated development

1
00:10.950 --> 00:14.870
environment for C++ on the Windows platform.

2
00:15.270 --> 00:20.520
CodeLite is a free, open source, cross-platform integrated development environment that works across

3
00:20.520 --> 00:22.770
Windows, Mac, and Linux.

4
00:22.830 --> 00:27.330
And this is the IDE that I'm going to use in this class.
In order to download it,

5
00:27.330 --> 00:33.310
open up your favorite browser and go to codelite, C O D E L I T E dot org.

6
00:33.690 --> 00:38.400
You'll get a page that looks similar to this and what you want to do is find a download link. 

7
00:38.400 --> 00:42.540
You can find it up here on the menu bar or you can find it right here as well, on the big blue button.

8
00:42.660 --> 00:48.150
So I'll select that and it takes you to a page where you can make a donation to the developers if you wish.

9
00:48.150 --> 00:52.310
If not, just take me straight to the downloads and I'll sect that.

10
00:53.400 --> 00:58.350
And you've got a couple of options here for Windows.
if you want to download the weekly builds you can

11
00:58.350 --> 01:02.900
download that for the 64 bit Windows machines right here at the top.

12
01:03.060 --> 01:07.620
And currently it's CodeLite 10.0.7.  That's the one I've been using and it's very

13
01:07.620 --> 01:08.790
very stable.

14
01:08.790 --> 01:14.850
You can also download the stable release 10.0 for Windows 64 or 32 bit.

15
01:14.850 --> 01:19.770
Now if you're not sure whether you have a 64 bit machine or a 32 bit machine. Go over to your Control

16
01:19.770 --> 01:28.950
Panel and select System and Security and then System. And in the System information right here you'll see

17
01:28.950 --> 01:35.160
System type and it will say 64 bit operating system or 32 bit operating system depending what you've

18
01:35.160 --> 01:35.940
got.

19
01:36.390 --> 01:41.880
So I'll close this down. In my case I have a 64 bit system so I'm going to use the stable release

20
01:42.090 --> 01:49.880
for Windows 64 bit and I can just click the direct link and that'll start the download. The download

21
01:49.890 --> 01:51.080
can take some time.

22
01:51.090 --> 01:52.010
It's not a big file.

23
01:52.020 --> 01:56.250
But the connection tends to be slow to the site, so I'll pause the video while that occurs.

24
01:56.400 --> 01:57.990
So the download is now complete.

25
01:57.990 --> 02:03.990
What I'm going to do is open it up in the folder and it's basically a compressed file which I'm going

26
02:03.990 --> 02:07.240
to extract right to here and then I'm going to run the installer.

27
02:07.260 --> 02:13.120
But before I do that I'm going to close the browser. Let's run that installer.

28
02:13.740 --> 02:19.950
I'm going to allow the app to make changes to my device and I'm going to close this folder just to clear

29
02:19.950 --> 02:20.880
up some of the clutter.

30
02:21.030 --> 02:24.160
Now what you want to do here is just basically follow the setup wizard.

31
02:24.300 --> 02:32.640
So, I'm going to select Next. I'm going to accept the GNU license agreement and press Next.  I'm going

32
02:32.640 --> 02:41.830
to install this to the default location C:\ Program Files\CodeLite and press Next and press Next again.

33
02:42.090 --> 02:47.200
And I want to create a desktop icon just to make it easier for myself and I'll press Next one more time.

34
02:47.310 --> 02:52.770
And then finally we can install the installation. It's really quick.

35
02:55.050 --> 02:57.990
And once it's done it's going to ask you if you want to launch CodeLite.

36
02:58.020 --> 03:00.090
I'm not going to launch it yet.

37
03:00.270 --> 03:05.280
I'm just going to finish the installation and in the next video will go over the launching and the configuration

38
03:05.280 --> 03:05.820
of CodeLite.
