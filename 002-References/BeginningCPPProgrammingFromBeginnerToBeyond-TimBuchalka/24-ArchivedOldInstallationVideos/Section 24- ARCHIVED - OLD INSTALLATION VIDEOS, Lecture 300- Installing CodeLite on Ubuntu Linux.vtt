WEBVTT

00:05.940 --> 00:12.720
In this video will be installing the code light IDE or integrated development environment on the Ubuntu

00:12.720 --> 00:14.040
Linux platform.

00:14.850 --> 00:21.840
Code light is a free open source cross-platform IDE that works with C++ and it works across Windows,

00:21.840 --> 00:23.920
Linux as well as Mac.

00:23.940 --> 00:32.850
So we'll start by opening up your favorite browser and going to code light that code light and you'll

00:32.850 --> 00:36.150
get a web page similar to this and you want to find the download link.

00:36.150 --> 00:39.240
Now there's one at the top menu and there's also this big blue button here.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.650
That's the one I'm going to use.

00:40.650 --> 00:46.500
So I'm just going to select code light to download and you can give a contribution to the developers

00:46.500 --> 00:49.770
if you wish, or you can go straight to the downloads, which is what I'll do here.

00:52.720 --> 00:58.330
Now we're we're going to download Code Lite 11.0, which is a stable release and we're going to download

00:58.330 --> 00:59.600
this for Ubuntu.

00:59.620 --> 01:04.720
Now you can see here you've got a Windows installer and OS ten installer and so forth and you can refer

01:04.720 --> 01:07.080
to those videos if that's the platform you're on.

01:07.090 --> 01:14.020
But this specific video is for Linux, so you could see here it says setup code lite repository for

01:14.020 --> 01:14.420
Ubuntu.

01:14.440 --> 01:15.760
That's the one I'm going to select.

01:17.810 --> 01:18.740
A word of caution.

01:18.740 --> 01:23.010
These commands are run a super user, as you can see here with the pseudo.

01:23.030 --> 01:25.340
So be very careful when you type things in.

01:25.340 --> 01:27.940
Make sure you're typing things exactly correctly.

01:27.950 --> 01:30.080
What I'm doing is I'm not even going to type.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.880
I'm simply going to copy and paste.

01:31.880 --> 01:32.300
That way.

01:32.300 --> 01:34.040
I know that I'm making no mistakes.

01:34.460 --> 01:38.540
So first step is to copy this one line right here.

01:38.540 --> 01:43.100
And basically what we've got to do this a lot of information on this page regarding official and unofficial

01:43.100 --> 01:45.980
and so forth, and I'll show you the one that worked great for me.

01:47.330 --> 01:52.190
So what we're going to do is we're going to copy this line of code here, then we're going to copy this

01:52.190 --> 01:53.240
line of code here.

01:53.660 --> 01:56.090
And the version I've got is initial universe.

01:56.090 --> 01:59.210
So that's the one I'm going to have 16.0 for boom two.

01:59.210 --> 02:00.860
So that's the one I'm going to choose.

02:00.860 --> 02:03.950
And then we're going to do a couple more lines and that's it.

02:03.950 --> 02:06.020
Now the install takes quite a while.

02:06.410 --> 02:10.130
The last time I did this install it was about 10 minutes, 15 minutes on my machine.

02:10.130 --> 02:14.960
So I'm going to pause the video as the install happens and we're going to do the install in a terminal

02:14.960 --> 02:15.470
window.

02:15.470 --> 02:17.270
So you can see the terminal window is here.

02:17.270 --> 02:21.950
I've opened it up so I'm going to make this just a little smaller so we can do both at once and you

02:21.950 --> 02:23.060
can see what's going on.

02:24.080 --> 02:24.890
Okay, perfect.

02:24.890 --> 02:26.090
So let's get started.

02:26.090 --> 02:34.760
Let's copy this first line right here and I'm going to copy and paste it over here, press enter and

02:34.760 --> 02:36.380
it's going to ask you for your password.

02:38.810 --> 02:43.010
Obviously, you have to have root access or be super user to install this code.

02:43.010 --> 02:48.100
So I'm going to press enter and that takes care of the first line.

02:48.120 --> 02:51.110
I'm going to scroll down and get the second line.

02:51.110 --> 02:58.270
Now make sure that you replace this string here with the correct distribution of your Ubuntu minus xeno.

02:58.280 --> 02:59.780
So that's the one I'm going to use.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.300
I'm going to copy this just like that.

03:05.410 --> 03:06.340
I'll paste it.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.040
This time it won't ask me for my password.

03:09.580 --> 03:12.490
Then I'll go down to the third line, which is the update.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.880
I'll copy that and paste it as well.

03:23.740 --> 03:25.800
And that'll just take us a few minutes.

03:28.610 --> 03:29.240
That's done.

03:29.270 --> 03:36.470
Now, the last line is the one that takes a long time to install someone, to copy, paste, press,

03:36.470 --> 03:39.620
enter, and I'll go have a cup of coffee in a little bit.

03:39.650 --> 03:43.800
It says here, after this operation, we need 451 megabytes of disk space.

03:43.820 --> 03:45.950
I've got plenty of disk space, so that's fine.

03:45.950 --> 03:47.150
And I'll just say continue.

03:47.150 --> 03:47.750
Yes.

03:49.550 --> 03:52.340
And I'll pause the video now and be back in about 10 minutes.

03:56.090 --> 03:58.700
At this point, code light has now been installed.

03:58.820 --> 04:01.490
In the next video, we'll run it and configure it.
