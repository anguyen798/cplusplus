00:05.050 --> 00:10.000
In this video, we'll go over the steps necessary to install the command line tools, which includes

00:10.000 --> 00:13.390
the C++ compiler on the MAC OS ten platform.

00:14.110 --> 00:16.430
In order to do this, we need to have a terminal window.

00:16.450 --> 00:22.630
So let's go over to Spotlight, search and type in terminal and we'll get a terminal window running.

00:22.750 --> 00:28.990
At this point, we want to type X Code Dash, select dash, dash install.

00:31.690 --> 00:32.680
And press enter.

00:33.850 --> 00:39.790
If you get a dialog box that pops up as I do, that means that the command line tools and the compiler

00:39.820 --> 00:41.620
are not currently installed.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.820
If you get a message saying that they are currently installed, then you're done.

00:45.820 --> 00:49.000
You can move on to installing the integrated development environment.

00:49.840 --> 00:55.870
In this case, I have the choice of installing the full Xcode integrated development environment or

00:55.870 --> 00:57.970
simply install the command line tools.

00:58.030 --> 01:01.990
I'm only going to install the command line tools, which again includes the compiler.

01:01.990 --> 01:03.460
So I'll select install.

01:05.020 --> 01:06.880
I'll agree to the license agreement.

01:10.270 --> 01:12.610
And the software will be downloaded and installed.

01:12.610 --> 01:14.140
It's a pretty quick process.

01:17.470 --> 01:22.090
After a few minutes, you'll see a message saying the software was installed and the installation is

01:22.090 --> 01:22.630
complete.

01:22.660 --> 01:31.540
You can test out the installation by simply typing G plus plus dash dash version at the terminal and

01:31.540 --> 01:36.250
you'll see the version number of the C++ compiler, which means it's all set and good to go.

01:36.370 --> 01:41.130
At this point, you'll keep the command line tools up to date through the App Store so you could select

01:41.140 --> 01:41.950
App Store.

01:44.180 --> 01:49.160
Updates and you can see your command line tool updates will appear here.

01:49.190 --> 01:52.610
Right now I've got no updates available because I just installed the latest.

01:53.300 --> 01:53.860
That's it.

01:53.870 --> 01:55.340
We've installed the command line tools.

01:55.340 --> 01:57.930
Our compilers are all set up and we're good to go.

01:57.950 --> 02:01.070
The next step is to install the integrated development environment.
