Hello, everyone.

00:06.330 --> 00:11.520
In this video, I'd like to show you how to use the source code that's provided with the course.

00:12.000 --> 00:19.080
Each section of the course contains a compressed zip file that contains a workspace and all the projects

00:19.080 --> 00:20.910
that I've created in that workspace.

00:20.910 --> 00:26.190
So, for example, suppose that we're working on Section eight, there'll be a Section eight zip file.

00:26.220 --> 00:29.250
It may be a different name, but it will have everything you need in there.

00:29.250 --> 00:35.220
And what you can do here is just extract that file and I'll extract here, and I'm simply going to extract

00:35.220 --> 00:36.540
it right to my desktop.

00:39.830 --> 00:41.800
You can see the folders have all been extracted.

00:41.810 --> 00:45.710
So if I double click on section eight, you can see all the projects in there.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.470
Now there's one special file you'll see down at the bottom here.

00:48.470 --> 00:51.080
It's called Section eight and it's a workspace file.

00:51.110 --> 00:57.890
If you right click on that, you can open with code light and that'll open up the workspace in code

00:57.890 --> 00:58.250
light.

00:58.250 --> 01:01.910
And once the workspace is open, you have access to all the projects in there.

01:01.910 --> 01:03.410
So that's one way to do it.

01:03.440 --> 01:07.850
Another way to do this is once you've extracted the file, just open code light.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.260
So now once code light is opened, you can choose to open a workspace right over here.

01:15.260 --> 01:20.960
So I'll select that open workspace and then you can just navigate to the workspace you want to open.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.270
In this case, it's on it's section eight workspace.

01:23.270 --> 01:27.830
You can just simply select that file and you can see the workspace opens up right here with all your

01:27.830 --> 01:28.520
projects.

01:28.520 --> 01:33.200
Now I'm going to close the workspace and show you another way to do it would be right up here.

01:33.200 --> 01:34.610
You just come to workspace.

01:34.610 --> 01:38.690
If you have a workspace that's already open, you can simply workspace close.

01:40.070 --> 01:41.090
It wouldn't be grayed out.

01:41.090 --> 01:42.040
It would be right there.

01:42.050 --> 01:43.940
In this case, I just want to open a workspace.

01:43.940 --> 01:49.340
And again, you navigate to the workspace you want to open, select it, and there it is.

01:49.340 --> 01:54.950
So now I've got Section eight workspace with all the projects that I created and provided for you.

01:55.340 --> 01:59.180
In order to run these projects, you simply double click the project you're interested in.

01:59.180 --> 02:01.820
And so suppose I want I'm interested in this Euros project.

02:01.850 --> 02:07.340
You can see the source code and all you really need to do is build and run.

02:07.340 --> 02:11.900
But I'd suggest that you clean it first, especially if you're going from Windows to PC to Linux.

02:11.900 --> 02:16.640
I'm developing on Windows, so if you're on a mac or Linux machine or even a Windows machine, it's

02:16.640 --> 02:18.650
always a good idea to clean the project.

02:18.650 --> 02:23.810
And what you can do, you can right click and clean, or you can come up to here where it says Build

02:23.810 --> 02:24.530
Clean.

02:25.010 --> 02:29.990
So we'll clean the project that removes all the object files, the X files, and just gets rid of a

02:29.990 --> 02:32.780
bunch of stuff that you might not need depending on your system.

02:33.320 --> 02:41.030
Now that we've got that ready, we can simply build and run and we should be good to go euro's to us

02:41.030 --> 02:41.450
dollars.

02:41.540 --> 02:45.410
So we'll type in 100, $119 is â‚¬100.

02:45.410 --> 02:46.370
So that's it.

02:46.370 --> 02:47.930
It's really pretty straightforward.

02:47.930 --> 02:53.210
What I would suggest is that you create obviously your own way of organizing your files.

02:53.870 --> 02:58.820
I'd use folders or directory structures, and also something that's important to understand as well

02:58.820 --> 03:01.190
with code like code light does things a little differently.

03:01.190 --> 03:08.270
So suppose that you've got projects in another workspace and then you select the workspace here and

03:08.270 --> 03:10.220
you say Add existing project.

03:10.430 --> 03:14.870
Well, what happens here is it doesn't actually copy that project into the workspace.

03:14.870 --> 03:20.480
It'll create a new project in this workspace, but the files will still be where they were before.

03:20.480 --> 03:25.460
So your dot CP files and your header files and everything will still be where they were.

03:25.460 --> 03:29.510
So think of this more of a logical project rather than a physical copy of it.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.260
But once you play around with it, you'll understand exactly what's going on.

03:33.260 --> 03:34.940
So really straightforward.

03:34.940 --> 03:40.490
You've got the zip files that were providing, unzip them, you have a folder structure and then just

03:40.490 --> 03:42.020
open that workspace file in there.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.280
All your projects should come in.

03:43.280 --> 03:44.270
No problem at all.
