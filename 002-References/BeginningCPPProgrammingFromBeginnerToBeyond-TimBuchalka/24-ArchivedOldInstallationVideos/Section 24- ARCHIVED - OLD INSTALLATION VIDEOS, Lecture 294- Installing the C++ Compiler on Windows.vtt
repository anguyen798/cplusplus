This video I'll take you through the steps necessary to install the C++ compiler on the Windows operating

1
00:11.530 --> 00:12.620
system.

2
00:12.700 --> 00:15.610
We're going to use the Minimalist GNU for Windows. 

3
00:15.680 --> 00:17.960
GNU stands for GNUs not Unix.

4
00:17.980 --> 00:26.320
It's basically a compiler collection called GCC that includes the C compiler,  C++ compiler,  Fortran compiler,

5
00:26.320 --> 00:27.460
and an Ada compiler.

6
00:27.550 --> 00:32.830
We're only going to be using the C++ compiler in this class so we'll only install that .

7
00:32.830 --> 00:39.280
Open up your favorite browser and you go to mingw.org. You'll see a page similar to this and what you want

8
00:39.280 --> 00:44.040
to do on this page is click on the button at the top right here called 'Download Installer'.

9
00:44.110 --> 00:51.990
So I'm going to select that and that'll automatically start a download of the MinGW installer.

10
00:52.000 --> 00:57.000
It's a pretty small file, so it should be a quick download depending on your internet connection.

11
00:57.340 --> 00:59.580
Ok so I'm finished downloading.

12
00:59.740 --> 01:01.990
And what I want to do is just run that installer.

13
01:01.990 --> 01:05.570
So I'm just going to double click on it and I'll close down the browser.

14
01:05.920 --> 01:10.440
OK so what we're going to do here is we're basically just going to follow the installation wizard.

15
01:10.540 --> 01:17.250
I'm going to install and I want to install in C:\MinGW 

16
01:17.380 --> 01:22.570
Now certainly this could be a different drive letter but don't change the name of the installation directory

17
01:22.570 --> 01:25.170
and certainly don't put spaces or anything in there.

18
01:25.180 --> 01:30.260
I'd suggest that you just keep the default if you can.  Keep all the default settings and press continue

19
01:31.960 --> 01:35.860
and this will start the download of the installation manager.

20
01:35.860 --> 01:42.130
Now once the installation manager is downloaded then we can continue and we can start downloading and

21
01:42.130 --> 01:44.200
installing the actual compiler.

22
01:56.270 --> 02:02.450
OK, so when the download is complete,  you can see that on my system it processed 113 items and it only

23
02:02.450 --> 02:03.440
took a couple of minutes.

24
02:03.440 --> 02:04.570
I sped up the video.

25
02:04.640 --> 02:07.000
so you didn't have to wait through the installation.

26
02:07.070 --> 02:13.220
Once you're finished, just press continue and you're going to be shown a window which is the installation

27
02:13.220 --> 02:14.350
manager.

28
02:14.360 --> 02:19.610
Now here what you want to do is you want to click Basic Set up on the left and you want to select three

29
02:19.700 --> 02:27.620
of these packages on the right.  You want to select the msys-base down near the bottom and you select

30
02:27.650 --> 02:29.220
mark for installation.

31
02:29.360 --> 02:31.940
You want to select the mingw32-gcc-g++

32
02:31.940 --> 02:40.490
package. That package contains the C and the C++ compilers and will mark for

33
02:40.490 --> 02:41.740
installation as well.

34
02:42.110 --> 02:47.880
And you want to select the mingw-base package and we'll mark that for installation.

35
02:47.940 --> 02:53.450
Now once you've got those three selected, you can come back up here to the installation menu and press

36
02:53.480 --> 02:56.860
apply changes.

37
02:56.870 --> 03:05.510
Now at this point we can click apply and it's going to download and install the new compiler.

38
03:17.720 --> 03:19.420
OK,  so that's the installation.

39
03:19.430 --> 03:22.790
It only took a couple of minutes on my machine. I'll select to close.

40
03:23.000 --> 03:25.900
And at this point we're done installing the compiler.

41
03:25.970 --> 03:31.460
Now there's one step that you should take. In this case we want to set the path variable on our Windows

42
03:31.460 --> 03:33.580
system to the binary directory.

43
03:33.590 --> 03:35.060
So let me show you how to do that.

44
03:35.060 --> 03:39.020
Open up your control panel.  You can open it up down here or you can open it up right here. I've just got

45
03:39.020 --> 03:44.990
a shortcut on my desktop and you can search your control panel for ENV for environment variables.

46
03:45.020 --> 03:49.670
I'll just type ENV and you can select Edit the system environment variables.

47
03:50.020 --> 03:50.610
OK.

48
03:50.840 --> 03:58.370
Now at this point you want to come down here to where it says 'environment variables' and press that and then

49
03:58.370 --> 04:06.680
down to 'system variables' and select the path right there and you want to edit the path.  And what you

50
04:06.680 --> 04:09.580
want to do is you want to add a new variable to the path.

51
04:09.570 --> 04:17.330
So going to select new and at this point you want to browse and find the directory where you installed

52
04:17.390 --> 04:18.980
the compiler libraries.

53
04:18.980 --> 04:21.540
So in this case it was my C-Drive

54
04:24.160 --> 04:30.560
and it was the MinGW directory and you want to go to the bin subdirectory and select that. That's where

55
04:30.560 --> 04:36.410
the binaries are for the executive files and then press OK and OK one more time.

56
04:36.410 --> 04:40.090
And just finish off and close everything up.

57
04:40.400 --> 04:41.250
That's it.

58
04:41.360 --> 04:46.820
The compiler system is now installed and we're ready to compile.  The next step is if you're going to

59
04:46.820 --> 04:52.130
install an integrated development environment or IDE now your compiler is all set up and you can proceed

60
04:52.130 --> 04:53.250
with that step.
