00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.620
In this section of the course,
we'll see how we can use

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.430
polymorphism and inheritance to
provide us with the power to create

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.390
reusable and flexible programs.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.579
We'll start by understanding
the different types of

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.630
polymorphism available in c++,
and then we'll focus on dynamic

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.290
polymorphism in this section.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.590
Then we'll learn how to use base class
pointers to really take our class

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.830
hierarchies to a new level and see
how we can now think more abstractly

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.730
and not have to worry about details.

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.260
Throughout this section of the
course, we'll see examples of

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:40.710
static and dynamic binding of
function calls, and we'll understand

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.199
the pros and cons of each.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.180
Then we'll use virtual functions to
achieve polymorphic functions, that is

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.130
functions that are bound at runtime.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:55.490
We'll see how important it is to
have virtual destructors, and use the

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.490
and use the c++11 override and final specifiers.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.459
Then we'll see how we can use
base class references to also

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.039
achieve dynamic polymorphism.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.190
Finally, we'll learn what pure
virtual functions and abstract

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.389
classes are, and why we would want
to use them as is and in interfaces.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.990
There's a lot to cover, but I think
you'll find this section pretty easy to grasp

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.690
since you have a
pretty solid foundation already.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.090
So let's get started
with polymorphism.
