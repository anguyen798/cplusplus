00:05.090 --> 00:05.870
Hello, everyone.

00:05.870 --> 00:06.680
Welcome back.

00:06.710 --> 00:13.040
In this video, I will create a default project template that we can then use to create new projects

00:13.040 --> 00:13.850
from.

00:13.850 --> 00:18.440
This makes us so much more productive and a lot less chances for errors as well.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.560
So we're going to create the project, save it as a template.

00:21.560 --> 00:25.100
Then when we create new projects, we'll use that template as the base.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.360
So let's get started.

00:26.360 --> 00:31.460
You notice here that I've got the previous workspace that I was working on in the installation videos,

00:31.460 --> 00:33.320
so let me just create a brand new workspace.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.650
I'll go through the flow again just so that you can see what it's like one more time.

00:36.650 --> 00:38.450
The more you see it, the easier it becomes.

00:38.450 --> 00:42.440
So I'm going to click right here new, create a new workspace.

00:43.370 --> 00:46.940
I'm going to select C plus plus workspace and click okay.

00:47.390 --> 00:51.470
Then I'm going to put it right inside my users folder Workspaces folder.

00:51.470 --> 00:53.570
I'm going to call this one Workspace two.

00:54.170 --> 00:56.150
Again, you can name that anything you like.

00:56.180 --> 01:00.320
Make sure create the workspace under a separate directory is checked.

01:00.350 --> 01:00.740
I'll click.

01:00.740 --> 01:02.270
Okay, Perfect.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.800
So now you can see our workspace has been created.

01:04.800 --> 01:08.460
Now I can right click on the workspace and create a new project.

01:09.710 --> 01:14.270
We can name this project again, whatever we like, so I'll just call it Project one.

01:15.680 --> 01:19.040
Make sure that create the project in its own folder is checked.

01:19.070 --> 01:27.590
The category is console type is simple executable g plus plus the compiler is mingw W on Linux and Mac

01:27.620 --> 01:29.990
you'll choose GCC for the compiler.

01:30.230 --> 01:36.110
The debugger is the gdb debugger on Mac, you will choose lldb vs code.

01:36.320 --> 01:41.240
And then we want to select the code light makefile generator as the build system.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.850
So I'll select and click okay.

01:43.850 --> 01:45.710
And that's going to create my project.

01:45.710 --> 01:51.530
As you can see in the workspace here with the source folder and the default main.cpp which we are going

01:51.530 --> 01:53.300
to remove and write our own.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.430
So let's do that real quick.

01:55.460 --> 02:08.630
Pound include IO stream just like we did before using I'll put a space here using namespace standard,

02:09.080 --> 02:11.970
then we'll create our main function right here.

02:12.240 --> 02:17.760
We'll say C out and what I'm going to do here is I'm going to display default template.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.260
End line again.

02:22.310 --> 02:22.750
End.

02:23.050 --> 02:25.810
Not in one and we'll return zero.

02:26.020 --> 02:26.860
That's it.

02:26.890 --> 02:29.770
Notice that this is red, so we need to save our project.

02:29.770 --> 02:33.190
I'm going to press control s on windows or command S on Mac.

02:33.460 --> 02:36.010
And we've got just what we had before.

02:36.010 --> 02:38.590
Now, before we build this, let's set up our project.

02:38.590 --> 02:42.640
So I'm going to select Project one and click on that wrench.

02:44.570 --> 02:46.010
In the general tab.

02:46.040 --> 02:49.430
I want to go to the working directory right here.

02:49.460 --> 02:56.330
Delete that and replace it with Project Path, just like we did before.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.940
Again, uppercase P for project and path.

02:59.270 --> 03:01.810
I'll press tab and it'll light up dark like that.

03:01.820 --> 03:03.380
You don't have to change anything else.

03:03.380 --> 03:04.880
In fact, don't touch anything else.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.410
It's just like it's supposed to be.

03:06.440 --> 03:13.700
We'll click on compiler now over here on the left, go to my compiler options and click those three

03:13.730 --> 03:20.810
dots in the button and I'm going to select Enable C plus plus 17 features right there, which is the

03:20.810 --> 03:23.180
stood C plus plus 17.

03:24.110 --> 03:24.840
I'll click okay.

03:24.860 --> 03:31.160
Then I can come over to my linker and if you like, you can put a dash static in the linker.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.050
Options again, dash static.

03:33.050 --> 03:34.370
No spaces in there.

03:34.370 --> 03:36.410
Mac users do not do this.

03:36.440 --> 03:37.390
Leave that blank.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.140
Otherwise you're going to get linker errors.

03:39.140 --> 03:42.020
So you can do this for Windows and for Linux.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.340
But Mac users.

03:43.370 --> 03:44.280
Leave it blank.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.210
That's it.

03:45.270 --> 03:46.230
I'll apply.

03:46.540 --> 03:46.950
I'll press.

03:46.950 --> 03:47.440
Okay.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.990
Now let's make sure that we can build.

03:48.990 --> 03:51.870
So we're going to come up here to build Rebuild project.

03:52.920 --> 03:55.060
We've got a clean build, no errors.

03:55.080 --> 03:57.030
Let's run it to make sure we can run it.

03:57.830 --> 04:01.310
And it should display default template.

04:01.550 --> 04:02.910
It does indeed.

04:02.930 --> 04:04.610
So we've got a good build.

04:04.610 --> 04:05.870
We've got a good project.

04:05.900 --> 04:12.140
Now what we can do is we can save this project as a template and we can use it later to create new projects

04:12.140 --> 04:14.890
from it without having to do all this setting stuff again.

04:14.900 --> 04:15.860
So let's do that.

04:15.860 --> 04:21.380
Let's right click on the project one and we'll come down here to where it says Save as template.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.880
Okay, let me do that one more time.

04:22.880 --> 04:26.060
Right click on Project one, Save as template.

04:26.960 --> 04:28.130
The project name.

04:28.130 --> 04:31.340
I'm just going to call this default project.

04:32.210 --> 04:34.130
You can call this anything you like.

04:34.550 --> 04:36.070
The project category.

04:36.080 --> 04:37.790
This says, Where am I going to store this?

04:37.790 --> 04:40.940
I'm going to store it in a category called User templates.

04:40.970 --> 04:43.970
It doesn't really matter where you put it as long as you remember where you put it.

04:43.970 --> 04:48.620
So user templates works for me and the description again can be anything.

04:48.740 --> 04:51.020
I'm just going to say my default project.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.290
There we go.

04:54.290 --> 04:54.950
And I'm going to press.

04:54.950 --> 04:55.610
Okay.

04:56.180 --> 04:57.020
Done.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.740
Now what we can do is we can create new projects from that template.

05:00.740 --> 05:01.830
So let's do that.

05:01.850 --> 05:03.560
I'll click on the workspace.

05:03.590 --> 05:06.590
I'll right click new project.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.970
The project's name Could be anything.

05:09.970 --> 05:11.620
I'll just say Project two again.

05:11.620 --> 05:16.030
Remember, no spaces, no special characters, no international characters anywhere.

05:16.480 --> 05:23.620
The category now what we'll do is we'll pick user templates and for type we'll pick default project,

05:23.620 --> 05:25.210
which is what we just created.

05:25.720 --> 05:33.880
Double check that you've got MinGW or GCC on Linux and Mac and the GNU debugger or the Lldb vs code

05:33.880 --> 05:34.660
on Mac.

05:34.780 --> 05:37.660
They should be populated from the template.

05:37.780 --> 05:42.010
We've got code like makefile generator, so you can just give it a once over and make sure everything

05:42.010 --> 05:43.840
looks good and I'll press.

05:43.840 --> 05:44.560
Okay.

05:44.860 --> 05:47.560
Now you can see that project two has been created.

05:47.560 --> 05:52.990
However, Project one is still the active project so we can make project two, the active project by

05:52.990 --> 05:54.370
just double clicking on it.

05:54.820 --> 05:58.440
And now Project two, you can see it's italicized and bold.

05:58.450 --> 06:04.000
So let me close this up here and let's open up our project Two's main.cpp.

06:04.300 --> 06:07.910
Notice I got the default template code which I wrote earlier.

06:08.300 --> 06:13.010
If I select Project two and I click the wrench, you can see that in the general.

06:13.010 --> 06:15.630
It did not keep the project path.

06:15.650 --> 06:19.640
Unfortunately, this is a bug that hopefully will be fixed soon.

06:19.640 --> 06:25.400
So in the meantime we'll just have to type project path just like that.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.910
But the compiler option did take.

06:28.940 --> 06:34.040
You can see this did equal C plus plus 17 and the linker option, you can see the static right here.

06:34.040 --> 06:38.630
So unfortunately, we still have to come in here and type project path, but it's a little bit less

06:38.630 --> 06:40.250
work than we had to do before.

06:40.280 --> 06:41.180
Apply.

06:41.330 --> 06:42.230
Okay.

06:42.230 --> 06:43.580
And we're good to go now.

06:43.580 --> 06:45.830
We can come over here to project to build it.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.460
And you can see the C plus plus 17 over here.

06:51.460 --> 06:53.440
You can see the static being used over here.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.320
So all this is good and we can build and run.

06:58.140 --> 06:59.070
And I'll execute it.

06:59.070 --> 07:02.970
And it should say default template, just like we did before.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.800
We can obviously change this and I'm going to say hello from project to.

07:09.850 --> 07:13.090
I'll save that and I can build and run again.

07:14.510 --> 07:15.460
There's our build.

07:15.470 --> 07:16.130
It's a clean build.

07:16.130 --> 07:18.710
Always be sure that you don't have any errors here before you run.

07:19.130 --> 07:20.210
I'll execute.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.230
And hello from Project two.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.210
So there you go.

07:24.230 --> 07:25.760
This makes life a little bit easier.

07:25.760 --> 07:32.600
Unfortunately, we still have to set that project path right here for the general options, but it's

07:32.600 --> 07:35.930
a lot less than we had to do before, and I think we're good to go here.

07:35.930 --> 07:37.640
So you can use this technique.

07:37.640 --> 07:41.900
So that finishes up the configuration of the default template.

07:41.930 --> 07:44.060
I'll see you in the next videos and we'll start coding.
