00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.400
In this section, we'll look at how we can create,

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.170
build and execute c++ programs

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.170
using only a simple editor in the command line.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.270
All we need on our system is a simple text editor.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.630
It's important to note that word processors such as Microsoft

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.030
Word and Apple Pages are not usually used to enter program code.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.230
Instead, we use basic text editors or programmer text editors.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.590
these types of editors are much simpler than integrated development environments.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.650
We also need an installed c++ compiler

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.650
like GCC or mingw on windows

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.010
and Apple's command line compilers on mac.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.970
That's it.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.460
At this point, we can create the c++ program using the text editor

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.820
and compile and run it by typing commands into the command line.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.200
This may sound intimidating at first but it's actually quite easy and efficient.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.700
That said, this is a workflow that's more commonly seen with experienced developers.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.060
However, you may wish to consider this approach if you find the IDEs too complex

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.720
or too difficult to understand.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.520
You might also consider this approach if your computer hardware resources

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.720
are insufficient to run an IDE.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.320
In any case, this is another option that you may use.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.080
In the next several videos, I'll show you how to edit,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.680
build and execute c++ programs

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.180
using only the command line in a simple editor.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.980
There will be separate videos for windows,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.980
macs and ubuntu Linux for your reference.
