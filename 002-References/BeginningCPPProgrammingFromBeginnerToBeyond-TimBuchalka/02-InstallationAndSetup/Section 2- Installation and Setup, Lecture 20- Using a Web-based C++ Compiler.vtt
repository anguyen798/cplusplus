00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.050
In this video, I'll show you a couple of options that allow you to run your c++ programs

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.250
right in a web browser.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.850
Now this is pretty nice because sometimes you're on the road, you don't have your computer with you

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.650
and you want to take the the course and try out some examples,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.310
maybe you had an idea about an example you want to try it out but nothing's available

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.910
or your friend's house, and there's no computer available there except the browser.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.270
All you need is a browser to run these.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.470
One example is if you open up your favorite browser I'm using chrome here,

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.370
you can type in cpp.sh. That's the URL.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.370
And you get the c++ shell.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.670
Now both of these examples I'm going to show you

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.550
are rather limited compared to obviously running on your own

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.550
computer with an IDE and so forth.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.300
But they're really, really handy when you need to try something out really quickly

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.500
without having to install a thing. So in this case, cpp.sh

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.940
is the c++ plus shell.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.300
You can type your program right in here on the browser.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.000
And you can see here I've typed in the hello world program.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.160
And you can set options. You can set your c++14 options,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.760
your warnings to a wall, like we have in the examples.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.010
And if you want to run your program, you can just select run.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.310
And it's going to compile and run it at the same time, which is pretty nice.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.870
Also, if the program asks for input, which we'll get to a little bit later in the course,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.920
you can set that to interactive mode. So it'll be able to -- you'll be able to type into the program,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.220
which is kind of nice as well. So in this case, I want to run the program.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.580
And you can see it's compiling.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.280
Program is running, and the output is hello world right here,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.940
and the exit code is 0, which is our return 0.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.800
That's pretty nice. Now you can get a URL,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.760
which gets a URL to what you did.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.850
And you can click on that URL and you got the program that you wrote back.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.110
So that's obviously it's storing it somewhere.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.310
I'm not sure where or how long it's going to be available,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.510
but you can figure that out if you like. That's one example.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.910
Another example is

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.070
webcompiler.cloudapp.net.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.170
This is a visual c++ plus compiler running in the web. It's a Microsoft compiler.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.420
And you can see that they've given you a sample program here.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.070
Now this text is pretty small. Again, it's a browser. So I'm going to make my browser a little bit bigger.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.130
So you can see it and then I'll make it a little smaller again to run it.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.030
So you can see here it's including iostream. It's using a namespace, which we'll talk about a little bit later

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.630
and it's outputting hello world.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.690
And let me make this a little smaller again. So when you run the program

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.690
by clicking this purple button down here,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.890
there's your output right up here in this black window here hello world,

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.690
which is pretty nice. And you can set your compiler flags,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.190
however, you like. So in this case I'm setting the warnings to all, and I'm setting my

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.490
standard compiler to c++14.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.170
I'll close that down. And so as you can see

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.720
this is pretty nice option here. We can -- if we get a compiler error let's

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.320
say we forget that semicolon and we run,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.820
then the compiler error shows up down here, it says in function main,

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.820
on line 7 right here.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.980
There's a semicolon expected. You actually get a little red

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.780
little x there that tells you the arrows right around here somewhere, so you can fix your error

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.780
and run it again.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.780
And there you go. There's your hello world. So again, these are some web-based options.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.440
They're not perfect. You can't really save things and edit

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.040
and do all kinds of good stuff, but

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.540
you can run a lot of the programs that we're going to talk

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.040
about in this class, right in the ++ shell on the web.
