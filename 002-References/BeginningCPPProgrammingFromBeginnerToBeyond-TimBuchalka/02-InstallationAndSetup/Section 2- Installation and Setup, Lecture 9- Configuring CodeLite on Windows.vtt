WEBVTT

00:05.060 --> 00:06.260
Welcome back.

00:06.290 --> 00:13.160
In the last video I installed code light on Windows and I created a shortcut icon on my desktop right

00:13.160 --> 00:13.610
here.

00:13.610 --> 00:18.920
So if I double click that, that's going to open up and run code light and the first time you run it,

00:18.920 --> 00:20.210
you're going to get a setup wizard.

00:20.210 --> 00:21.470
It's going to look something like this.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.360
It says, Welcome to the setup wizard.

00:23.360 --> 00:28.190
You can bypass the setup wizard, but let's run it and we'll select next.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.060
And we'll select C plus plus development.

00:32.990 --> 00:33.830
Select next.

00:33.830 --> 00:34.450
Again.

00:34.460 --> 00:37.760
Now, in this step you can scan for compilers.

00:37.760 --> 00:41.120
And the idea here is we've got a compiler installed on our system.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.840
Code light needs to configure itself to work with that compiler.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.530
So we'll select scan.

00:47.540 --> 00:49.700
Most of the time it will not find it.

00:51.360 --> 00:53.100
And in this case.

00:55.490 --> 00:56.690
It did not find it.

00:56.690 --> 00:56.910
Okay?

00:56.960 --> 00:58.000
Just I expected.

00:58.010 --> 00:59.210
Do you want to install one?

00:59.210 --> 01:02.030
It thinks we don't have one yet, so don't install anything.

01:02.030 --> 01:05.240
Just close this up and we'll manually configure it in a moment.

01:05.570 --> 01:07.880
Don't worry about what shows here.

01:07.880 --> 01:14.450
I've got the Microsoft C plus plus compiler installed as well, along with the GNU G plus plus compiler.

01:14.450 --> 01:17.480
So most likely you're only going to see Rust.

01:17.480 --> 01:18.830
So just click next.

01:19.800 --> 01:23.070
Here we select the colors that we want for our interface.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.800
Normally I will work in dark.

01:25.890 --> 01:29.910
I'm just going to select system default because I think that the light actually I'm going to select

01:29.910 --> 01:34.350
light because I think that the light shows up a lot better on video than the dark.

01:34.380 --> 01:36.000
So I'm going to select next.

01:36.910 --> 01:38.680
I'll just press finish now.

01:38.710 --> 01:43.630
Don't change any of these settings and code light is going to close up and restart.

01:44.890 --> 01:46.060
And that's it.

01:46.060 --> 01:49.750
So let me make this a little bigger and show you what's going on here.

01:49.750 --> 01:51.220
We've got our menu at the top.

01:51.220 --> 01:53.920
And over here on the left, we've got a workspace view.

01:53.930 --> 01:56.680
In the workspace view is where we see our workspace.

01:56.680 --> 02:03.940
And our workspace can consist of many projects, which is really great because we can have a workspace,

02:03.940 --> 02:09.190
for example, for Section six and have all the projects related to Section six in here.

02:09.190 --> 02:11.350
Or you can have a workspace named anything you want.

02:11.380 --> 02:15.910
Maybe you're learning about pointers and you want to create a workspace called pointers and then having

02:15.910 --> 02:19.020
projects within that workspace all about pointers.

02:19.030 --> 02:22.870
Once you have workspaces, they'll be available down here.

02:22.930 --> 02:24.490
Recently opened workspaces.

02:24.490 --> 02:28.810
Now, obviously I've just installed this, so I've got nothing in here, so that's a real easy way to

02:28.810 --> 02:31.330
pick previously used workspaces.

02:31.330 --> 02:37.120
And then you see this right over here where it says, open an existing workspace, create a new workspace

02:37.120 --> 02:37.690
and so forth.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.700
And we'll be using those in just a moment.

02:39.700 --> 02:45.060
But before we do anything, we need to set up and configure our compiler here.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.460
So let's do that.

02:46.460 --> 02:51.050
I'm going to go up here to Settings and then I'm going to press build settings.

02:51.830 --> 02:56.060
And there you can see those three items that we saw a little while ago during our build.

02:56.090 --> 03:01.610
Now, at this point, I want to click that blue plus symbol right here on some versions.

03:01.610 --> 03:03.680
I think it's the Linux version of the Mac version.

03:03.680 --> 03:06.590
That's a green plus, but in this case, it's a blue plus.

03:06.590 --> 03:10.970
So I want to make sure I'm on that compilers tab right up here and I'm going to click that.

03:10.970 --> 03:13.460
Plus it says Add an existing compiler.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.440
So I'm going to click it now.

03:15.440 --> 03:21.890
I'm going to go to where I installed my compiler and I installed it on my C drive in the min GW folder

03:21.890 --> 03:22.940
right there.

03:23.330 --> 03:25.310
And I want to select the bin.

03:25.340 --> 03:27.290
That's the path that I want.

03:27.320 --> 03:32.570
That's where all my binaries are, the executable files for the compiler and I'm going to select folder.

03:32.570 --> 03:36.140
At this point it's asking us to name the compiler.

03:36.440 --> 03:38.870
I'm going to name it Min GW.

03:41.060 --> 03:43.960
Just like that, I encourage you to do the same.

03:43.970 --> 03:45.350
Select okay.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.320
And now code Light has set up the compiler.

03:48.320 --> 03:52.560
You can see it's set up the compiler path, the assembler paths and all this good stuff.

03:52.560 --> 03:58.620
And a good sanity check is to look through here, make sure that you've got MinGW w64 bin because that's

03:58.620 --> 03:59.910
where all this stuff is.

04:00.150 --> 04:03.630
And once we're done with that, we can click okay, great.

04:03.660 --> 04:09.900
Now we're in a position where we can start writing code, creating workspaces, creating projects and

04:09.900 --> 04:10.440
so forth.

04:10.440 --> 04:11.910
So let's go through those steps.

04:11.910 --> 04:15.150
There's still a little bit more configuration, but not a lot more.

04:15.150 --> 04:21.540
So what we can do here is we don't have any workspaces yet, so we can create a new workspace.

04:21.630 --> 04:27.300
I can click over here on this big button over here on the right, or I can go up to workspace new workspace.

04:27.300 --> 04:30.510
And I think you can even do a file new workspace.

04:30.510 --> 04:30.900
Yep.

04:30.900 --> 04:31.440
Right there.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.420
So there's a lot of different ways to do it.

04:33.540 --> 04:36.120
I'm just going to click on this big button because it's pretty easy.

04:36.860 --> 04:40.040
Now it's asking us what type of workspace do we want?

04:40.070 --> 04:42.230
We want a C plus plus workspace.

04:42.230 --> 04:44.210
So make sure you select C plus plus.

04:44.240 --> 04:44.660
Click.

04:44.660 --> 04:45.380
Okay.

04:46.980 --> 04:50.610
So now it's asking us, where do you want to store this workspace?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.650
So here you've got a lot of choices.

04:52.650 --> 04:57.900
You can store this wherever you like, sort of do not install this on cloud drives.

04:57.900 --> 05:02.460
Do not install workspaces on folders with really weird names.

05:02.460 --> 05:06.870
And the other thing I would recommend is not to install it on your desktop or your documents.

05:06.870 --> 05:09.090
I used to do that all the time and it worked great.

05:09.090 --> 05:15.360
But more and more we have systems that are using one drive and one drive is managing the desktop and

05:15.360 --> 05:19.320
the documents folders and it's putting them somewhere else where they normally aren't.

05:19.320 --> 05:25.560
So what I would recommend is that we go right in here, right in our users and whatever your user name

05:25.560 --> 05:26.790
is, my name is Mitro.

05:26.790 --> 05:29.460
In this example, that's going to be your own username.

05:29.460 --> 05:34.920
What I encourage you to do is just click those three little buttons here and right now I'm in the home

05:34.920 --> 05:40.890
folder and right in here I want to create a new folder and I'm just going to call this workspaces.

05:43.560 --> 05:44.730
Just like that.

05:44.730 --> 05:46.200
And I'm going to select that.

05:46.740 --> 05:54.930
So my workspace path is my home directory, my users username folder, and I want to create a new workspace.

05:54.930 --> 05:56.880
So let's call this workspace one.

05:58.410 --> 05:59.970
We can call it whatever we want.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.760
We can call it, you know, this week's workspace, whatever we like.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.360
Now, what's something that's very, very important?

06:06.630 --> 06:09.240
Do not put spaces anywhere.

06:09.270 --> 06:11.760
Do not use special characters.

06:11.850 --> 06:14.760
Just keep it really, really, really simple.

06:14.790 --> 06:16.900
No international characters.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.020
No spaces, No special characters.

06:19.020 --> 06:20.850
Just keep it plain and simple.

06:20.970 --> 06:23.400
These build tools are really, really picky about that.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.190
So that's my workspace.

06:25.200 --> 06:30.840
Make sure that create the workspace under a separate directory is checked and click okay.

06:31.230 --> 06:36.060
Now you can see over here on the left that we've got a new workspace that's been created and that's

06:36.060 --> 06:36.270
great.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.830
That's exactly what we want.

06:37.830 --> 06:44.020
But we need projects within that workspace and the projects themselves are each going to be a C plus

06:44.020 --> 06:45.100
plus program.

06:45.520 --> 06:47.420
So how do you think we create a project?

06:47.440 --> 06:48.490
Real easy.

06:48.520 --> 06:56.140
Click on your workspace and you can come up to file new project or we can right click on the workspace

06:56.140 --> 06:57.730
and create a new project.

06:57.730 --> 06:58.690
That's what I'm going to do.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.350
Now we're going to get a new project Wizard.

07:02.440 --> 07:05.980
Notice the path is the workspace one that we created.

07:06.010 --> 07:08.230
Now it's asking us, what's the name of your project?

07:08.230 --> 07:10.060
I'm just going to call it Project One.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.590
Remember, we can have as many projects as we like within that workspace.

07:14.710 --> 07:19.980
Make sure create the project in its own folder is checked and these are really important settings here.

07:19.990 --> 07:21.220
What's the category?

07:21.220 --> 07:24.310
We want to build a console based application.

07:24.310 --> 07:28.750
That's an application that runs in a console window, a command prompt window.

07:28.780 --> 07:31.060
We're not doing graphical user interfaces.

07:31.060 --> 07:32.740
That would be a whole different course.

07:32.890 --> 07:38.080
The type is going to be simple executable, G plus plus.

07:38.650 --> 07:41.560
Now it's asking us what compiler did we install?

07:41.560 --> 07:43.570
Well, we installed the min GW compiler.

07:43.570 --> 07:46.510
That's the one that we installed a minute ago and named it.

07:46.510 --> 07:49.060
So I'm going to select that for debugger.

07:49.060 --> 07:52.000
You can choose the new GDB debugger.

07:52.720 --> 07:59.140
And now for the build system, this is where the developer that created code light really changed things

07:59.240 --> 08:01.670
up In 17.34 years.

08:01.670 --> 08:05.060
There has been a default build system in here that worked great.

08:05.090 --> 08:07.670
He got rid of the default build system.

08:07.670 --> 08:09.850
I don't know why, but he did.

08:09.860 --> 08:11.900
So we have to work without that now.

08:11.900 --> 08:15.890
And what we're going to choose is code light make file generator.

08:15.920 --> 08:19.820
So let me click those again and it should just be there when you start.

08:19.820 --> 08:23.590
But just to be sure, you've got a couple of options here.

08:23.600 --> 08:26.510
Code light make file generator is what we want.

08:26.510 --> 08:29.390
So that's the one I'm going to choose and I'm going to click.

08:29.390 --> 08:30.170
Okay.

08:31.780 --> 08:33.960
Now we've got a project over here.

08:33.970 --> 08:35.790
It's got a source folder.

08:35.800 --> 08:40.140
That's where we're going to put our source code and it's got a main.cpp file.

08:40.150 --> 08:46.780
The Main.cpp file is our C plus plus source code, and the name of the file is Main.cpp.

08:47.080 --> 08:52.390
So let me double click that and that's going to open it up here in my editor.

08:52.420 --> 08:55.930
This is where I can change my program, add code and so forth.

08:55.960 --> 09:00.790
I'm going to go to my settings for a minute and I'm going to go to my colors and fonts and I'm just

09:00.790 --> 09:04.480
going to make this font a little bit bigger just so it's easier for you all to see.

09:04.510 --> 09:08.470
You don't have to do this, but I think it's going to make a big difference here.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.220
There we go.

09:09.220 --> 09:14.470
So now what we're going to do is we're just going to get rid of all this because that's really c-like

09:14.470 --> 09:15.100
code.

09:15.130 --> 09:17.680
Now, you'll notice what happened when I got rid of that.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.200
You'll notice that red dot that came right up here.

09:20.230 --> 09:24.520
That means that whatever changes I've made to this file have not saved.

09:24.640 --> 09:30.670
So we can save what we've done by just going to file, save, file or control s on windows.

09:31.060 --> 09:35.960
It's really important that we always save before we try to build and run anything.

09:36.260 --> 09:40.550
So in this case, let's start writing a real simple Hello world program.

09:40.550 --> 09:48.440
First thing we're going to do is pound include and we're going to say i o stream inside angle brackets.

09:49.280 --> 09:55.980
Then I'm going to type using namespace STD followed by a semicolon.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.970
At this point, just type along and follow along.

09:58.970 --> 10:03.800
All this is going to be explained in the course and now we need to write a main function.

10:03.800 --> 10:10.220
This is the place where our program is going to begin executing, so we're going to type in int space

10:10.250 --> 10:16.220
main left, n right per N, Then we're going to have a left curly brace.

10:16.220 --> 10:21.040
And you'll notice when I press enter code light automatically closed that for me.

10:21.050 --> 10:24.290
So it's using those smart braces, which is really, really handy.

10:24.440 --> 10:28.310
And in here all we're going to say is C out.

10:30.090 --> 10:33.270
Two less than signs or left angle brackets.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.880
Side by side with no space between them.

10:35.880 --> 10:39.450
Make sure there is a space between see out and those angle brackets.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.340
Then again, another space.

10:41.340 --> 10:47.490
And then I'm going to type Hello world in double quotes, just like that.

10:48.090 --> 10:54.300
Then I'm going to follow that with two more left angle brackets or two less than signs followed by the

10:54.300 --> 10:59.640
word E and L, not E and one, but E and DL.

10:59.670 --> 11:03.360
Now you'll notice, as I was typing, code light was helping me.

11:03.360 --> 11:09.000
It's got code completion, so it's helping me and I'm just going to indent this so it all lines up nicely.

11:09.030 --> 11:13.500
It's trying to figure out what I want to type next and helping me out so I can just press tab and I

11:13.500 --> 11:14.780
don't have to type it all in.

11:14.790 --> 11:17.430
So in this case, we have one more statement to write.

11:17.430 --> 11:18.990
It's going to be return.

11:18.990 --> 11:25.140
And you can see when I type RET, it's giving me the return so I can just press tab and it'll finish

11:25.140 --> 11:25.940
it for me.

11:25.950 --> 11:30.840
Returns zero with a space between the return of the zero and a semicolon.

11:30.850 --> 11:31.570
That's it.

11:31.570 --> 11:33.270
This is our first program.

11:33.280 --> 11:36.180
Why do we write a Hello World program?

11:36.190 --> 11:42.460
Well, it's become the norm, and the reason we do it is if we see Hello World display when we run this,

11:42.490 --> 11:47.350
we know that our development environment has been set up correctly and it's a pretty easy way to do

11:47.350 --> 11:47.650
it.

11:47.680 --> 11:50.080
Now you'll notice I am still red here.

11:50.660 --> 11:54.170
So I want to press Ctrl s or file save.

11:54.170 --> 11:58.820
I'm going to press Ctrl s and that has now changed to that little X there.

11:59.450 --> 12:02.520
Now you'll notice these red arrows popping up.

12:02.540 --> 12:03.830
Don't worry about those.

12:03.830 --> 12:06.440
Those will go away in a second when we do the build.

12:06.440 --> 12:10.040
But before we do the build, we need to configure our compiler.

12:10.250 --> 12:15.530
So what we can do is remember, it's possible that we have a lot of projects in here.

12:15.560 --> 12:20.840
There's only going to be one active project at a time, and that's the one that's bold and italicized,

12:20.840 --> 12:23.330
and there's only one right now, but you can see it right here.

12:23.720 --> 12:27.740
You can always right click on that and make it active.

12:27.890 --> 12:32.000
And by double clicking on it, you can choose which project you want to build.

12:32.030 --> 12:35.560
Again, we can have 2030 projects, just double click them.

12:35.570 --> 12:36.640
That's the one we want.

12:36.650 --> 12:38.840
So let's configure this project.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.630
So make sure that you've selected Project one.

12:41.660 --> 12:46.580
Then I'm going to come up to this wrench icon right here that gives us our project settings.

12:46.580 --> 12:49.610
You can also right click and come down to settings.

12:49.610 --> 12:51.660
You can see the wrench icon there.

12:51.960 --> 12:56.880
So again, I'm going to just click that icon and now we get this Project Settings menu.

12:57.540 --> 13:03.330
I know this looks like a lot to do right now and it is in a sense, but in a while we won't have to

13:03.330 --> 13:08.550
do any of this because we're going to create a template project that we can create new projects from.

13:08.550 --> 13:12.550
And I'll do that in a couple of videos from now, which makes it really, really easy to do.

13:12.570 --> 13:14.670
So what do we have here?

13:14.670 --> 13:18.180
This is some of the options that I selected in that new project Wizard.

13:18.180 --> 13:22.200
There's the code like make file generator, the min GW.

13:22.230 --> 13:25.410
So what we want to do here is we want to make one change to this.

13:25.440 --> 13:31.560
We want to delete the working directory right here, the whole thing.

13:31.560 --> 13:40.770
I just want to delete it all and I want to type in dollar and then left per n project path right foreign

13:40.830 --> 13:41.700
just like that.

13:41.700 --> 13:48.210
So you should have a dollar sign a left per n project path and a right closing parenthesis.

13:48.210 --> 13:52.110
Make sure that the two paths in Project path are capitalized.

13:52.650 --> 13:53.520
That's it.

13:54.180 --> 13:56.700
We press tab and you can see it light up like that.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.140
I'm going to apply.

13:59.030 --> 13:59.840
And I'm going to select.

13:59.840 --> 14:00.530
Okay.

14:01.580 --> 14:01.870
Okay.

14:01.950 --> 14:04.520
Now, that basically set up our environment.

14:04.550 --> 14:07.910
Now what we want to do is we want to set up the compiler option.

14:07.910 --> 14:10.040
So again, I can do I didn't have to leave that one.

14:10.220 --> 14:10.490
Okay.

14:10.490 --> 14:12.070
But you can just open it again.

14:12.080 --> 14:15.110
And now we're going to select the compiler right up here.

14:17.130 --> 14:20.490
You can see I've got a C plus plus compiler and a C compiler.

14:20.510 --> 14:25.070
We're only working with the C plus plus compiler, so I want to set some options for that.

14:25.100 --> 14:27.320
You can see there's already a few options set here.

14:27.530 --> 14:31.520
Dwarf and capital O and a wall and all that explained as the course goes on.

14:31.520 --> 14:37.090
So click here and you'll see these three little dots that pop up right here in a button.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.810
So we're going to select that.

14:39.140 --> 14:43.030
And now we've got a whole bunch of options that we can select from.

14:43.040 --> 14:46.100
We're only going to select one more, and that's that one right here.

14:46.100 --> 14:49.490
Enable C plus plus 17 features.

14:49.520 --> 14:54.740
There's two of them, but make sure you select the one that says Dash stood equals C plus plus 17.

14:54.740 --> 14:58.220
And you can see down here in the command line, those are the commands that are going to be used by

14:58.220 --> 15:00.350
the compiler to build the program.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.980
Now I'm going to select okay, apply.

15:04.250 --> 15:06.290
Okay, now we're done.

15:06.710 --> 15:10.100
Now what we can do is we can build and run this program.

15:10.100 --> 15:11.600
So how do we do that?

15:11.720 --> 15:16.200
Make sure that your project you want to run is the active project again, In this case, there's only

15:16.200 --> 15:19.050
one project we can come up to build.

15:19.740 --> 15:21.230
We can do a build.

15:21.240 --> 15:27.750
There's a lot of options here that I'll explain as we go, but we can select Rebuild project and we

15:27.750 --> 15:29.640
get the output window come up down here.

15:29.640 --> 15:31.950
Let me just move this up a little bit.

15:31.980 --> 15:34.440
This is the build output right here.

15:34.440 --> 15:40.740
And you can see that it's successfully has created a program, which is pretty cool.

15:40.770 --> 15:43.380
Now what we can do is we can run this program.

15:43.380 --> 15:50.010
So let me close that and I'm going to select, build, Run, and it's going to ask me, do you want

15:50.010 --> 15:52.460
to build it and execute it or just execute it?

15:52.470 --> 15:54.810
I just want to execute it because I've already built it.

15:56.940 --> 15:59.610
A window pops up and it says Hello world.

16:00.060 --> 16:04.290
This tells you that your build environment is set up, your compiler is set up, everything is working.

16:04.290 --> 16:05.400
Everything looks good.

16:05.430 --> 16:07.740
Now all we displayed was Hello world.

16:07.770 --> 16:10.830
The rest of the stuff is displayed by code light.

16:10.860 --> 16:14.250
It tells you that your program exited with an exit code of zero.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.450
That is a good thing.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.690
An exit code of zero means that your program ran successfully.

16:18.840 --> 16:22.200
That's basically what we're returning that zero right here for.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.630
And again, we'll explain all this as we go.

16:24.690 --> 16:26.920
Right now, we're just trying to get the environment set up.

16:26.940 --> 16:28.350
We're displaying Hello World.

16:28.350 --> 16:29.430
We're returning that zero.

16:29.430 --> 16:30.180
Everything worked.

16:30.180 --> 16:31.420
There was no other error.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.650
How much time did the program take to run?

16:33.660 --> 16:34.770
There you see it.

16:34.770 --> 16:36.960
And then it says Press Any key to continue.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.650
And if I press enter, the window goes away.

16:40.770 --> 16:41.640
So that's it.

16:41.670 --> 16:43.800
We've built our first program.

16:43.950 --> 16:44.760
It was pretty easy.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.970
I think it's just a matter of setting these little steps up.

16:47.970 --> 16:53.700
So let me create another project and I'm going to use this same source code and I'm just going to copy

16:53.700 --> 16:54.750
that so I don't have to type it in.

16:54.750 --> 17:00.520
Again, I'm just using Ctrl C and I can close this window down here just to reduce some of the clutter.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.050
So what do I want to do now?

17:02.050 --> 17:06.280
Well, I want to click on the workspace, right click new project.

17:08.890 --> 17:12.780
And my project name is Project two.

17:13.930 --> 17:15.280
I'm going to remember the life settings.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.960
So it's a console based program.

17:16.960 --> 17:22.750
It's simple executable min GW the GNU debugger and code light Makefile generator.

17:23.110 --> 17:23.680
I'll select.

17:23.680 --> 17:24.370
Okay.

17:24.760 --> 17:29.500
Once that's done, I've got my main and notice I've got two mains now.

17:29.500 --> 17:29.760
Right?

17:29.770 --> 17:35.320
Project one has a main which is this one and project two has a main which is this one.

17:35.320 --> 17:41.980
So I'm just going to get rid of this and copy what I did and I'm going to say Hello world from Project

17:42.010 --> 17:44.290
two like that.

17:44.290 --> 17:46.780
Notice that's red up here, so I want to save it.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.460
You'll notice Project one is the active project.

17:50.490 --> 17:52.350
You see how it's bold and italicized.

17:52.370 --> 17:57.860
I can just double click on Project two and now Project two is the one that's bold and italicized right

17:57.860 --> 17:58.160
there.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.570
So it's the active project.

17:59.570 --> 18:03.230
So when I build and run, Project two is the one that's going to be affected.

18:03.500 --> 18:06.740
So I'm going to click the wrench again.

18:07.530 --> 18:10.290
And I'm going to go up to my general options.

18:11.010 --> 18:12.240
I'm going to get rid of this.

18:12.240 --> 18:15.600
And again, as I said, we're not going to have to do this every time, but we're just going to do it

18:15.600 --> 18:16.410
this time.

18:16.620 --> 18:18.870
I'm going to create Project Path.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.660
Be real careful here.

18:21.660 --> 18:26.220
I didn't put a capital P and it must be a capital P just like that.

18:26.220 --> 18:27.900
Then I'm going to get my compiler.

18:28.730 --> 18:33.530
And I'm going to come right over here and I'm going to add these two equals C plus plus 17.

18:35.300 --> 18:36.380
Just like that.

18:36.500 --> 18:40.610
You might want to select the linker and type static.

18:41.780 --> 18:42.950
That's up to you.

18:43.070 --> 18:49.280
I would recommend you do so because it's going to avoid problems with finding DLLs and Windows and so

18:49.280 --> 18:49.640
forth.

18:49.640 --> 18:56.000
So all you have to do is just click on the linker options and type static or hyphen static, all one

18:56.000 --> 18:57.200
word, no spaces.

18:57.440 --> 19:01.680
We'll click apply, we'll click okay and that's it.

19:01.700 --> 19:02.510
We're ready to build.

19:02.510 --> 19:04.100
So now I'm going to go to build.

19:05.050 --> 19:06.430
Rebuild project.

19:07.960 --> 19:08.560
There we go.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.930
We have a clean build.

19:09.940 --> 19:14.530
And if we run, it's going to say hello from project to.

19:16.460 --> 19:17.990
And that's exactly what we see here.

19:17.990 --> 19:18.500
Hello world.

19:18.500 --> 19:19.580
From project to.

19:21.170 --> 19:22.100
Pretty good.

19:22.340 --> 19:22.880
All right.

19:22.880 --> 19:23.720
So.

19:24.350 --> 19:28.370
If you have build errors, it's possible we get build errors every day.

19:28.380 --> 19:28.570
Right?

19:28.580 --> 19:29.870
So here's an example.

19:29.900 --> 19:38.300
I spelled this wrong instead of i o stream, I wrote i o stream and now these red arrows are coming

19:38.300 --> 19:41.300
back up saying i o stream file not found and so forth.

19:41.300 --> 19:45.740
So these things kind of help you before we build to let us know something's not right.

19:45.740 --> 19:49.100
But if I do try to build my project, you see I'm going to get errors here.

19:49.100 --> 19:53.570
It's going to go IO stream and it's going to say no such file or directory.

19:53.620 --> 19:58.550
It's kind of telling you something's not right and we've got an error message down here.

19:58.580 --> 19:59.750
The build ended with errors.

19:59.750 --> 20:02.810
So when that happens, we know we've got a problem.

20:02.810 --> 20:06.320
If you run into things like this, they're usually pretty easy fixes.

20:06.350 --> 20:08.600
A lot of times they're just typos, right?

20:08.600 --> 20:12.100
So if I put that back in and build, we'll be good to go.

20:12.110 --> 20:17.600
But if you post something on the Q and A about it, and I'll say rebuild your project and show me the

20:17.600 --> 20:19.970
build output, this is what I want to see down here.

20:19.970 --> 20:22.040
So we've got several tabs here.

20:22.040 --> 20:26.910
So you would just click the build tab and copy and paste all this stuff or give me a screenshot and

20:26.910 --> 20:28.230
I can really help you with that.

20:28.410 --> 20:31.800
Similarly, if we let me close this, we get a new one.

20:31.800 --> 20:35.610
If I forgot that semicolon semicolons are really important.

20:35.640 --> 20:41.190
You can see that little red arrow is popping up saying, Hey, I expected a semicolon somewhere right

20:41.190 --> 20:43.530
after here, but if I do build.

20:45.590 --> 20:47.480
Again, I'm going to get an error right there.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.260
It's pointing at it.

20:48.260 --> 20:50.200
It says, hey, I'm expecting a semicolon.

20:50.210 --> 20:56.060
We can't run our program until we get a clean build so I can put the semicolon back in.

20:56.270 --> 20:59.390
And as you can imagine, there's a lot of places to make mistakes.

20:59.390 --> 20:59.630
Right?

20:59.630 --> 21:01.220
I spell Main wrong.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.620
I forget one of these quotes here.

21:03.650 --> 21:06.290
We have to close them up a whole bunch of places.

21:06.290 --> 21:08.510
I forget this closing curly.

21:09.020 --> 21:11.240
So there are a lot of places where things can go wrong.

21:11.240 --> 21:16.220
But once you have this environment set up and you've got a build, we're good to go.

21:16.220 --> 21:18.980
We can proceed and we can write code in the course.

21:19.010 --> 21:26.090
Now, the last thing I'd like you to do is come up to Settings preferences and come over here to where

21:26.090 --> 21:32.570
it says miscellaneous and it says check for new version on startup and just unclick that otherwise it's

21:32.570 --> 21:36.260
going to really pester you a lot saying hey, there's a new version of code light out there.

21:37.040 --> 21:40.910
Resist the urge to download and install new versions.

21:40.910 --> 21:45.300
New versions often come with bugs, often come with a lot of changes.

21:45.300 --> 21:49.500
Once you have your development environment set up for this course, just leave it alone.

21:49.500 --> 21:52.850
Use it that way for the whole course and you're not going to have any trouble.

21:52.860 --> 21:57.990
Don't just keep updating it every point release because that's that's just asking for trouble and for

21:57.990 --> 21:59.640
misconfiguration errors.

21:59.670 --> 22:00.060
Okay.

22:00.060 --> 22:02.520
So I'm going to click apply and.

22:02.520 --> 22:03.300
Okay.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.580
And we're pretty much done.

22:05.580 --> 22:10.080
So if you've gotten this far and you've got your build system all set up, congratulations, we're good

22:10.080 --> 22:10.860
to go.

22:11.010 --> 22:17.550
Next step is to head over to the video where I'm going to show you how to set up a project template

22:17.550 --> 22:20.130
so that you don't have to go through all the stuff that I just went through.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.480
We only have to do it once.

22:21.480 --> 22:27.440
And then from that point forward, we just create a new project based on an existing project and all

22:27.440 --> 22:33.000
of this project path and all of this compiler stuff and all of this linker stuff is going to be done

22:33.000 --> 22:35.760
for us automatically so we don't have to do that again.

22:35.850 --> 22:36.120
All right.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.410
So I'll see you in that video.
