00:05.480 --> 00:06.470
Hello, everyone.

00:06.470 --> 00:12.590
In this video we're going to configure code light to work with the compiler that we've already installed.

00:12.590 --> 00:16.340
So at this point, we've installed the compiler and we've installed code light.

00:16.370 --> 00:20.090
The first time you run code light, you're going to get a welcome message like this.

00:20.090 --> 00:22.340
And this is basically a setup wizard.

00:22.340 --> 00:28.010
If you don't get this the first time you run code light, you can just come up to help and select run

00:28.010 --> 00:29.750
the setup wizard right there.

00:29.870 --> 00:30.160
Okay.

00:30.170 --> 00:31.490
But I did get the setup wizard.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.550
Also, you might get the light mode or you may get the dark mode.

00:34.550 --> 00:36.920
It really depends on how you've got your Mac set up.

00:36.920 --> 00:40.670
So what we want to do is we do want to run this setup wizard.

00:40.670 --> 00:43.430
So once it comes up, we want to click next.

00:44.050 --> 00:46.930
We want to select c c plus plus development.

00:47.290 --> 00:48.880
Select next again.

00:49.720 --> 00:54.610
And now we're going to ask code light to scan our system for installed compilers.

00:54.610 --> 00:57.700
Since we've already installed a compiler, it should find one.

00:57.700 --> 01:00.370
So I'll select scan and you can see it.

01:00.370 --> 01:01.420
Found a bunch of stuff.

01:01.420 --> 01:03.220
The most important one is the GCC.

01:03.250 --> 01:05.050
That's the one we're going to use.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.830
If you see a GCC there, you're good to go.

01:07.840 --> 01:11.800
So I'm going to select next Then what theme do I want to use?

01:11.800 --> 01:13.900
You can use a light theme or a dark theme.

01:13.900 --> 01:17.680
I'm just going to stick to the dark theme because the light theme, although it comes off better on

01:17.680 --> 01:22.690
video, is giving me some really weird glitchy stuff with the recording that just doesn't look good.

01:22.690 --> 01:24.310
So I'm going to select next.

01:25.540 --> 01:28.330
Don't make any changes here and click finish.

01:29.990 --> 01:33.410
Now code light is going to stop and restart.

01:34.030 --> 01:36.580
And once you're opened up, we're good to go.

01:36.580 --> 01:39.370
Now down here, you can see where it says local workspaces.

01:39.370 --> 01:40.300
There aren't any yet.

01:40.330 --> 01:45.610
Once we start creating workspaces, they will show up here and you can easily go back to previously

01:45.610 --> 01:47.920
used workspaces by just clicking on them.

01:48.040 --> 01:54.310
The idea here is we want to create a workspace and then within that workspace we want to create projects.

01:54.310 --> 01:57.550
Each project would be a working C plus plus program.

01:57.550 --> 02:00.430
So the first step is to create a workspace.

02:00.430 --> 02:01.870
Now, there are several ways to do it.

02:01.870 --> 02:04.360
You can see the workspace view over here.

02:04.390 --> 02:08.590
We can select new Create Workspace, this big button right here.

02:08.590 --> 02:10.990
We can go to workspace, new workspace.

02:10.990 --> 02:14.800
And I believe we can go to file new workspace as well.

02:14.800 --> 02:16.540
So there's a lot of places we could do it.

02:16.540 --> 02:19.120
I'm just going to click this big button right here.

02:19.330 --> 02:21.370
Now, what is the workspace type?

02:21.370 --> 02:23.170
Well, we're going to stick to C plus plus.

02:23.170 --> 02:24.400
That's what we'll be using.

02:24.400 --> 02:27.190
So I'm going to select C plus plus and click okay.

02:27.640 --> 02:32.650
Now it's going to ask me where I want to store these workspaces and what I want to name them.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.280
So you've got some choices here.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.920
You can put them in your documents, you can put them on your desktop.

02:36.920 --> 02:41.990
I'm going to create a path right off of my home directory and I'm going to call it workspaces.

02:42.010 --> 02:45.290
Then I'm going to create as many workspaces as I want within that area.

02:45.290 --> 02:49.640
That way I'm nicely organized, so I'm just going to click this button over here with the three dots,

02:49.640 --> 02:55.220
and right here I'm going to create a new folder and I'm going to call it workspaces.

02:55.370 --> 02:59.240
Let me make that a capital W workspaces.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.140
That's it.

03:00.140 --> 03:01.040
I'll create it.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.110
And I'll select it.

03:03.110 --> 03:09.530
And you can see now that the workspace path is going to be my home folder workspaces and the workspace

03:09.530 --> 03:13.160
name for the workspace that I'm going to create now is going to be called Workspace One.

03:13.160 --> 03:17.150
That can be anything that could be Section five, that could be pointers.

03:17.150 --> 03:22.490
If you're working on pointers, anything that makes sense for you, make sure that create the workspace

03:22.490 --> 03:26.300
under a separate directory is checked and click okay.

03:26.480 --> 03:32.870
Now you can see over here in the Workspace view, you have a workspace created called Workspace One.

03:32.900 --> 03:36.620
Now that's not real useful until we create projects and that's the next step.

03:36.620 --> 03:38.510
Let's create some projects within it.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.640
So we'll start with creating one project.

03:40.640 --> 03:44.780
So I'm going to right click on there and select new project.

03:44.810 --> 03:47.540
Again, you can go up to file new project.

03:47.570 --> 03:51.170
A lot of different ways to do it, but let's just right click on the workspace.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.850
You create a new project?

03:55.640 --> 03:58.150
Okay, so now we've got our new project wizard.

03:58.160 --> 04:03.200
You can see that this project is going to go into Workspace one, which is the workspace we have open.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.110
And what do you want to name your project?

04:05.120 --> 04:06.290
You can name it anything you want.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.030
I'm going to name it Project One.

04:09.120 --> 04:12.120
Now something that's really, really important throughout.

04:12.150 --> 04:14.250
Do not use any spaces anywhere.

04:14.280 --> 04:20.340
Do not use any special characters like pluses and dots and dollar signs and all kinds of weird things

04:20.340 --> 04:22.950
and do not use any international characters.

04:22.950 --> 04:25.470
So just keep it really plain simple.

04:25.470 --> 04:29.490
No spaces, no international characters, no special characters.

04:30.000 --> 04:34.440
Once we do that, we want to check the create the project in folder.

04:35.090 --> 04:38.080
Then what category console.

04:38.090 --> 04:41.060
We're going to run these programs in a terminal window.

04:41.270 --> 04:45.860
The type is going to be simple executable, G plus plus.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.220
So again, simple executable G plus plus.

04:49.940 --> 04:53.090
The compiler we're going to use is the GCC compiler.

04:53.090 --> 04:55.640
You may have other choices here, but just select GCC.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.870
The debugger is going to be the Lldb Vscode debugger.

05:00.870 --> 05:02.100
That's the one on Mac.

05:02.490 --> 05:06.570
And the build system is code light Makefile generator.

05:06.720 --> 05:08.640
And again, you've got some choices here.

05:08.640 --> 05:14.550
Two choices we're going to use that one in version 17.3, which is the version that I'm running now

05:14.550 --> 05:15.540
of code light.

05:15.570 --> 05:18.590
The developer removed the default build system.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.220
Unfortunately that makes it a little tougher for us to configure this.

05:22.230 --> 05:23.790
The default build system work great.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.920
I really don't know why he removed it, but he did.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.660
So we'll deal with it.

05:27.750 --> 05:30.270
At this point, we're going to click okay.

05:30.950 --> 05:34.550
And you can see in the workspace project one has been created.

05:34.580 --> 05:40.010
There is a source folder for our source code and there is our main.cpp file.

05:40.100 --> 05:44.450
So if I double click on that, you can see the source code right there and I'm going to make this a

05:44.450 --> 05:45.320
little bit bigger.

05:45.320 --> 05:53.000
So I'm going to go over to my settings, colors and fonts and I'm going to set the font to something

05:53.000 --> 05:54.980
around 20 or so so you guys can see.

05:55.090 --> 05:55.280
Let's see.

05:55.310 --> 05:56.150
24.

05:56.630 --> 05:58.280
So I'll click okay.

06:00.190 --> 06:03.160
And then I'll click apply and then okay, there we go.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.660
So that fonts a little bit easier to see now on video.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.270
So what are we going to do?

06:07.300 --> 06:12.000
We're going to remove all this and we're going to write a real simple program.

06:12.010 --> 06:15.830
Now notice that when I did that, this little red dot showed up.

06:15.850 --> 06:20.740
What that means is that whatever is in here, in my editor, has not been saved.

06:20.860 --> 06:24.580
So this is a good clue for you to make sure you save everything.

06:24.580 --> 06:27.190
So let's write the program and then we'll worry about saving it.

06:27.250 --> 06:30.300
At this point, just type along and follow along.

06:30.310 --> 06:34.060
The point of this video is to make sure that our development environment is set up.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.890
It's not about learning C plus plus yet.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.750
We'll have plenty of time to do that.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.070
All this will be explained.

06:39.070 --> 06:41.560
So pound include.

06:42.830 --> 06:49.340
We have a left angle bracket or less than sign iostream and the right angle bracket.

06:49.640 --> 06:56.590
Then we're going to say using namespace space STD with a semicolon at the end.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.930
Make sure you have spaces between using namespace and STD.

07:00.500 --> 07:07.580
Now we're going to write the main function, so we're going to type int int space main left n right

07:07.580 --> 07:09.830
per n and then a left curly brace.

07:10.930 --> 07:18.730
And in here we're just going to say C out to left angle brackets side by side, no spaces between them.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.880
And I'm going to say hello world.

07:22.030 --> 07:23.770
That's what I'm going to display.

07:23.890 --> 07:27.550
Make sure that that hello world is within double quotes the whole thing.

07:27.670 --> 07:32.230
Then we have to left angle brackets and end for an end line.

07:32.260 --> 07:35.860
Make sure that that's end and not end one.

07:36.220 --> 07:40.480
And then we're going to return zero with a semicolon at the end.

07:40.510 --> 07:43.090
Make sure there's a space between the return and the zero.

07:43.120 --> 07:43.900
That's it.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.790
Now you can see that that red dot is there.

07:45.790 --> 07:51.070
So I'm going to save this and I'm going to press command S You can also come up to file save file,

07:51.070 --> 07:54.900
but I'm just going to press command s and that little red dot is gone.

07:54.910 --> 07:59.980
Before we build this, we need to configure our compiler to work with this project the way we want.

08:00.010 --> 08:06.370
The way we can do that is you'll notice that Project one right there is bold and italicized that tells

08:06.370 --> 08:10.430
code Light and us that this project is the active project.

08:10.430 --> 08:12.770
Remember, we could have many projects in here.

08:12.800 --> 08:16.250
The active project is the one that's going to be built and run.

08:16.250 --> 08:18.710
So it's really important that we select the one we want.

08:18.740 --> 08:20.930
In this case, there's only one, so it's pretty easy.

08:20.930 --> 08:25.340
So I want to select the project and then I'm going to come up here and click that wrench icon.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.700
I can also right click on the project and come down here to settings.

08:29.710 --> 08:30.550
Same thing.

08:30.550 --> 08:32.620
So I'm just going to click that wrench icon.

08:34.250 --> 08:35.780
And we get our project settings.

08:35.780 --> 08:39.110
Now, most of this we're not going to mess with, we're just going to leave it alone.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.870
Most of this has been set up for us already.

08:41.870 --> 08:46.160
There's one thing that we definitely have to do is this working directory right here.

08:46.490 --> 08:51.770
I'm going to come over here and I'm going to delete what's in there and I'm just going to type dollar

08:51.800 --> 08:59.300
left per N and the word project path with no spaces and both PS are uppercase.

08:59.300 --> 09:00.590
Then I want to press tab.

09:00.710 --> 09:08.240
So dollar left per n project path right per n and the two PS and project path uppercase.

09:08.450 --> 09:09.380
That's it.

09:09.410 --> 09:11.360
Now we'll go over to the compiler.

09:12.430 --> 09:16.980
Select it on the left and right where it says C plus plus compiler options.

09:16.990 --> 09:21.640
I'm just going to click on there and this little button with three dots shows up.

09:21.640 --> 09:27.370
I want to click that and I'm going to come over here and I'm going to select Enable C plus plus 17 features

09:27.370 --> 09:28.390
right there.

09:29.080 --> 09:34.210
That's going to use the C plus plus 17 version of the C plus plus compiler select.

09:34.210 --> 09:35.010
Okay.

09:35.020 --> 09:36.100
At this point, we're done.

09:36.100 --> 09:36.640
I'll select.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.450
Okay.

09:37.450 --> 09:40.270
And now I'm going to come over here and build this project.

09:40.270 --> 09:42.700
I'm going to come up here and I'm going to select Build.

09:43.460 --> 09:45.140
And rebuild the project.

09:45.140 --> 09:48.020
When I do that and output pane comes up down here.

09:49.940 --> 09:51.340
And you get the build.

09:51.350 --> 09:55.930
Notice that the C plus plus 17 shows up over here and so forth.

09:55.940 --> 09:57.380
So this is a good build.

09:57.380 --> 09:59.150
It says build completed successfully.

09:59.150 --> 10:00.620
No errors, no warnings.

10:00.650 --> 10:04.670
Our program has been built, so now we have an executable that we can run.

10:04.760 --> 10:08.030
When we run that executable, we expect it to say Hello world, right?

10:08.030 --> 10:09.260
And that's what we wrote.

10:10.200 --> 10:10.530
Great.

10:10.530 --> 10:12.030
So I'm going to close this.

10:12.910 --> 10:15.640
And I'm going to come up to build and now I'm going to run.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.870
Do we want to build it again and execute?

10:18.920 --> 10:19.670
No, I've already built it.

10:19.670 --> 10:20.870
I just want to execute it.

10:21.610 --> 10:25.480
And we get a terminal up here and you notice it says Hello world right there.

10:26.440 --> 10:27.830
Right there.

10:27.850 --> 10:29.230
So we've got a good build.

10:29.230 --> 10:30.190
We've got a good run.

10:30.200 --> 10:35.620
And it says hit any key to continue and you can hit the key and get used to closing this window like

10:35.620 --> 10:38.740
that by clicking on that little red dot up there.

10:38.740 --> 10:39.730
So that's it.

10:39.760 --> 10:41.350
We've got a program.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.400
It's running.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.200
It's pretty easy to do.

10:44.230 --> 10:46.630
We can create another project, so why don't we do that?

10:46.630 --> 10:47.410
Let's do that.

10:47.410 --> 10:49.540
I'm going to click the workspace again.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.160
Right click.

10:52.620 --> 10:54.930
New new project.

10:55.830 --> 10:59.520
I'm going to put it in the same workspace, but I want to call this one project to.

11:02.310 --> 11:03.960
Again, you can name these anything you want.

11:03.990 --> 11:09.170
Just be sure that there are no spaces, no international characters and no special characters.

11:09.180 --> 11:13.710
I know I say that a lot, but there are so many support questions, and when things don't work, it's

11:13.710 --> 11:18.720
almost always there's a dollar sign somewhere, there's a dot somewhere, there's a percent sign somewhere,

11:18.750 --> 11:20.070
there's a space somewhere.

11:20.070 --> 11:21.630
So be sure you don't have any of that.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.860
So again, make sure create the project in its own folder.

11:24.870 --> 11:32.340
We've got console simple executable g plus plus GCC lldb vs code code light makefile generator.

11:32.340 --> 11:34.920
So it remembered the previous settings I'll select.

11:34.920 --> 11:35.640
Okay.

11:37.190 --> 11:41.390
We'll go over to the project and we'll select the wrench.

11:42.660 --> 11:46.740
We'll come over here to General and in the working directory.

11:47.590 --> 11:49.240
We'll delete what's there.

11:51.330 --> 11:56.820
And we'll replace it with duller open paren project path.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.080
Close the parentheses.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.370
Just like that.

11:59.730 --> 12:01.290
Then we'll come over to compiler.

12:02.660 --> 12:06.920
We'll select the compiler options, the C plus plus compiler options right there.

12:07.220 --> 12:08.690
Click that little button.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.220
Select Enable.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.530
C plus plus 17 Features.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.430
Select.

12:13.430 --> 12:14.210
Okay.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.000
Apply these settings and hit.

12:17.000 --> 12:17.660
Okay.

12:17.660 --> 12:18.590
And we're done.

12:18.620 --> 12:22.760
Now we can write our code for the project too.

12:22.790 --> 12:27.620
So in this case, you'll notice this is the code for Project one, and you can tell up here where it

12:27.620 --> 12:29.060
says Project One.

12:30.030 --> 12:35.210
If we select this code now, Project two opens up and that's the main CPP file.

12:35.220 --> 12:39.990
So what I'd like to do is I want to reuse this code here, so I'm going to just copy it.

12:40.850 --> 12:43.930
I'm doing command A and then command C to copy.

12:44.040 --> 12:49.580
I'm just going to come in here and paste it with Command V, so I'm just going to say Hello world from

12:49.580 --> 12:50.600
project to.

12:52.650 --> 12:53.340
That's it.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.880
I'm going to save because it was unsaved before.

12:56.910 --> 13:02.520
If I build now, it's going to build Project one because you can see Project one right here is italicized.

13:02.520 --> 13:09.060
Project one is the active project, so we can make Project two, the active project by right clicking

13:09.060 --> 13:12.720
and saying make active, or we can also just double click on it.

13:12.750 --> 13:17.430
Now you can see Project two is italicized and bold and it's good to go.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.200
So now I can build.

13:19.950 --> 13:25.050
And I can build my project or rebuild my project, I'll go into more the differences between those in

13:25.050 --> 13:25.740
the class.

13:25.770 --> 13:27.480
We have a clean build.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.620
I come up to build and run, execute.

13:31.620 --> 13:36.150
And at this point we should see Hello from project to that's exactly what we see.

13:36.150 --> 13:38.610
And you can make this window bigger by just hitting command.

13:38.610 --> 13:42.510
Plus, if you like, you can see a little bit better hit enter to continue.

13:42.540 --> 13:44.610
We're done and we'll close this window up.

13:46.190 --> 13:46.880
That's it.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.590
We're pretty much done with this.

13:49.100 --> 13:54.950
A couple of videos down refer to the video that shows us how to make a default project template because

13:54.950 --> 13:58.850
that'll save us some time from having to do all this stuff over and over and over again.

13:58.850 --> 14:04.370
What we can do is we can create a default project template and then create new projects from it, and

14:04.370 --> 14:05.900
all our settings will be there already.

14:05.900 --> 14:10.790
So the last thing I'd like you to do is to come up to code light preferences.

14:11.780 --> 14:13.940
And go over here to miscellaneous.

14:14.690 --> 14:15.980
And there's a setting right here.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.870
Check for new version on startup.

14:17.900 --> 14:18.980
Uncheck that.

14:20.250 --> 14:27.090
My advice would be once you have a working code, light setup and compiler setup, don't mess with it.

14:27.090 --> 14:28.800
Use it throughout the course.

14:29.100 --> 14:33.590
Many times as developers we want oh, I want the latest and greatest.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.580
That's usually a really bad idea.

14:35.610 --> 14:38.070
The latest and greatest is usually on the bleeding edge.

14:38.070 --> 14:40.110
It's buggy and there's all kinds of issues.

14:40.110 --> 14:45.000
So once you have a working development environment, leave it alone, don't mess with it.

14:45.000 --> 14:50.370
So just uncheck that and this thing won't keep prompting you and pestering you to update to the latest

14:50.370 --> 14:52.260
and greatest, which may not be.

14:52.260 --> 14:55.260
So I'm going to apply click okay.

14:55.260 --> 14:56.970
And at that point we're done.

14:56.970 --> 14:58.830
We're almost ready to start coding.

14:58.830 --> 15:04.110
Refer to the section about creating the default template and I'll see you in the next video.
