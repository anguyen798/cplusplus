00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.700
Hello everyone.
Frank here.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.060
This is the video that's going to be showing you how to install the MinGW

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.860
64 compiler.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.160
I know there's been a lot of trouble with servers and VPNs

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.160
and Firewalls and all kinds of stuff,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.660
so hopefully this will, will help with that.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.260
So let's get started.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.660
Open up your favourite browser and head over to winlibs.com.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.150
This is, is a library where they've got standalone builds of GCCN,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.050
MinGW 64 for Windows.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.850
And once we're here, we want to click the download link right here.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.550
And what we're at now is, we're at a page
where we can download different versions of the compiler.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.240
We can download 32 bit or 64 bit versions of the compiler.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.790
This depends, obviously on the architecture that you've got on your machine.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.590
So it's really important that you, make sure you got the right one.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.590
If you're not sure whether you've got a 32 bit operating system

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.190
or a 64 bit operating system, it's really easy to tell.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.790
Just press the Windows key and type Control Panel in the search

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.890
and head over to the Control Panel

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.890
and then click on System and Security.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.080
And then under System view the amount of Ram and processor speed

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.280
and that will display this window.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.880
And you can see right here where it says System type.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.180
Mine says 64 bit operating system,

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.980
 x 64.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.980
Yours might say 32 bit operating system, x 86.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.780
So be sure you've got the right one.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.980
I know I've got a 64 bit system,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.180
so I'm going to download the 64 bit version of the compiler,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.980
which is this one right here, Windows 64.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.980
And I'm going to download this zip archive.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.480
Don't download these over here on the right, just this one right here.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.280
Or if you're on a 32 bit system, this one right here.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.970
Now as far as whether it's version 12.2 or 3 or 1 or whatever is out there,

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.570
just download the latest one. Okay?

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.870
As of this recording, this is the latest one.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.470
So I'm going to click on that and download the zip archive.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.070
Now I've already done that to save two times and I put it on my desktop

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.670
and here it is.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.770
Now what we want to do is

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.370
We want to extract that zip archive.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.370
There's no installer built-in,

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.570
you can't just double click and have this compiler install.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.870
What we want to do is Just unzip this file,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.570
store it in a place and then update the Windows path

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.370
and that's all we need to know when we're done. It's a pretty easy thing to do.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.370
So, I want to right click on here and I want to select Extract All

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.970
and get rid of all this extra stuff that's in here.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.970
All we want to really put in there is C colon back slash.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.350
C colon back slash. That's it.
That's all we want to do here.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.350
What's going to happen is

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.610
This is going to be extracted to a MinGW 64 folder right here.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.510
Don't put this in program files.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.710
Don't put it anywhere else.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.310
Just put it right off your C drive.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.710
So, you can select, show extracted files when complete,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.710
I'm not, I'm just going to click Extract.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:04.010
And this process takes a little while.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.610
There's about 7900 items that it has to extract.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.830
So, it might take a couple of minutes.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.330
I'll speed up the video here just to save a little bit of time.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.320
All right, so the process is almost complete.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.820
It probably took about four minutes on my computer and we're done.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.820
We've unzipped that archive.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.320
Now, what we want to do is

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.320
Open up file explorer and go over to your C drive.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.820
And you will see a folder called MinGW 64.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.420
You can see it right here, that's what was just created.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.420
And if I double click on there,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.920
you'll see the bin folder, the include folder.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.520
These are all the folders that the MinGW C++ compiler needs.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.920
This is the most important one, the bin folder.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.720
That's where all the binaries are.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.920
This is where the actual compiler and the linker and the loader and all this good stuff is at.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.220
So, this is the path that we want to add to Windows,

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.720
so that Windows can find this compiler,

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.710
whenever we need it.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.310
So the easiest way to do that is, just click on this little folder right here.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And there's your path, you can see it c:/mingw64/bin.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.500
I just want to right click on that and copy.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.400
And at this point, I want to close down explorer because I'm done with it.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.980
Now, what we want to do is

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.980
We want to set our Windows environment variable.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.980
And again, this is really easy to do.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.730
So I'm just going to come down to my taskbar

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.730
and just click the search and type environment.

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.630
And you can see right here it says, Edit the system, let me try that again.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.330
There we go.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.330
Edit the system environment variable, so I'm going to select that.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.820
And I get this little window that pops up.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.620
Let me move this out of the way.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.520
There we go.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.920
And you'll see this button right here, environment variables. That's what we want to select.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.510
And I want to come down to my system variables down here

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.200
and look for the variable called Path, you can see it right there.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.800
And this is the one that we want to edit. So I'm going to select the edit button.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.000
And we've got a bunch of stuff in here.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.600
And it's really important that you don't mess with anything that's in here

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.200
because that could really cause issues.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.100
All we want to do is add a new path variable.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.600
So I'm going to select new.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.200
And right here, I'm just going to right click and paste what I copied earlier.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.890
And now you can see that I've added the mingw64/bin

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.390
path to my existing path.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.190
Perfect.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.490
Click OK.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.090
Click OK again.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.090
And click OK once more.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.890
That's it, our compiler is installed, we can test it really quickly.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.250
Again, I'm going to press the Windows key

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.850
and I'm just going to type command CMD

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.390
 and open up a command prompt window

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.380
and you can see it right here.

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.980
And all we have to do here is type g++ -- version

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.580
and press Enter.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.580
And if our compiler is installed correctly, we should get information about the compiler.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.880
And there's the information, you can see it 12.2,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.080
0 was the version, we installed

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.680
and we're pretty much done installing the compiler.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.140
If you type just g++, it'll say something about

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.640
fatal error, no input files, that's okay, that's a good install.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.330
It's just telling you, hey, I don't know what to compile.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.690
You haven't provided anything.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.190
So if you type g++ and you get this

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.190
error here, it's okay, it's a normal error.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.880
But g++ -- version is what we really want to type

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.170
to be sure that we've got our chamber, we installed. Okay?

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.170
So that's it, that takes care of installing the MinGW 64 compiler.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.530
In the next video, we'll install Code Lite

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.530
and then we'll get Code Lite to talk to this compiler so that Code Lite

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.830
 can use the compiler to compile our source code.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.830
I'll see you in the next video.
