00:05.160 --> 00:06.210
Hello everyone.

00:06.210 --> 00:08.970
In this video we'll be installing code light.

00:08.970 --> 00:11.520
Code light is an integrated development environment.

00:11.520 --> 00:17.520
What that is, is basically a piece of software that allows us to enter our code, build our programs,

00:17.520 --> 00:20.610
run our programs, test our programs all in one place.

00:20.640 --> 00:22.230
Code light is open source.

00:22.230 --> 00:25.280
It's free, it's cross-platform, and it works really well.

00:25.290 --> 00:32.580
So open up your favorite browser and head over to code light org and you'll see a web page that looks

00:32.580 --> 00:33.410
like this.

00:33.420 --> 00:36.180
Then you want to click on the download button.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.330
And you'll get this page.

00:39.330 --> 00:42.460
And if you want to support the developer, please, by all means do so.

00:42.480 --> 00:45.330
I'm going to click not now continue to the download page.

00:46.490 --> 00:49.460
I'm recording this in June of 2023.

00:49.670 --> 00:58.430
They just released the code light 17 .3.0 Build Code lite became really unstable in code lite 17.

00:58.430 --> 01:01.670
So this 17.3 build is pretty good.

01:01.700 --> 01:04.790
The only problem is that it changed the way that we build things.

01:04.790 --> 01:08.300
So going forward, we're going to use 17.3.

01:08.630 --> 01:15.890
Also, if you're downloading this in the future and you see something like 17.5 or 18 or something like

01:15.890 --> 01:18.710
that, check the resources section for this video.

01:18.980 --> 01:21.500
A lot of times I'll say just stick to 17.3.

01:21.530 --> 01:26.210
Don't update to 18.0 because you could have bugs in those releases.

01:26.210 --> 01:33.020
So I want to install 17 .3.0 and I'm going to click the Windows 64 installer here and that's going to

01:33.050 --> 01:35.860
download an executable file that's an installer.

01:35.870 --> 01:41.030
Now I've already gone ahead and done that and I saved it to my desktop and you can see that right here.

01:41.030 --> 01:43.910
Now if I double click this and install it.

01:45.990 --> 01:47.910
You might get something that looks like this.

01:47.940 --> 01:49.500
Windows protected your PC.

01:49.890 --> 01:52.350
Microsoft Defender does this a lot.

01:52.350 --> 01:56.190
And basically what it's saying is, hey, I don't know where this file came from.

01:56.190 --> 01:57.910
It's not from the Windows store.

01:57.930 --> 01:59.620
If you get this, that's okay.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.200
It's really easy to work around it.

02:01.230 --> 02:03.810
What you can do is you right click on the installer.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.460
And select properties.

02:06.880 --> 02:10.960
Then in the general tab, you'll see right here security unblock.

02:11.320 --> 02:14.690
If you do that, then you can run the installer with no problems.

02:14.690 --> 02:15.850
So I'm going to apply.

02:16.060 --> 02:16.360
Click.

02:16.360 --> 02:16.990
Okay.

02:17.020 --> 02:18.610
Now I'm going to double click.

02:20.680 --> 02:25.210
And I get this little message that pops up that says, Your app is going to change my device.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.080
I want it to.

02:26.110 --> 02:26.740
So I'm going to click.

02:26.740 --> 02:27.400
Yes.

02:28.530 --> 02:29.740
And here's the installer.

02:29.760 --> 02:30.870
There's the license agreement.

02:30.870 --> 02:32.370
You can read it and agree to it.

02:32.580 --> 02:33.450
I'll accept it.

02:33.450 --> 02:34.650
I'll select next.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.060
Now where do we want to install this?

02:37.090 --> 02:40.180
I would strongly recommend to not change this.

02:40.210 --> 02:41.140
Leave it alone.

02:41.170 --> 02:42.310
C Program files.

02:42.310 --> 02:44.320
Code light is a great place to install it.

02:44.350 --> 02:46.270
Do not install this on a shared drive.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.640
Do not install this on a cloud drive for example.

02:48.640 --> 02:49.690
One drive.

02:49.720 --> 02:54.270
Don't change these names and start adding really strange symbols and things in there.

02:54.280 --> 02:57.760
That's just asking for trouble with builds later on.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.770
So select the default.

03:00.550 --> 03:01.540
Click next.

03:02.890 --> 03:05.530
And it says the program code already exists.

03:05.530 --> 03:07.480
Would you like to install to that folder anyway?

03:07.480 --> 03:11.830
Yours probably won't say that mine is saying it because I already had code light installed, so I'm

03:11.830 --> 03:12.340
going to select.

03:12.340 --> 03:13.060
Yes.

03:15.310 --> 03:16.760
Give the program a name.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.260
I'll select next again.

03:18.280 --> 03:21.570
Do you want to create a desktop icon and a quick launch icon?

03:21.580 --> 03:22.090
I'll say yes.

03:22.090 --> 03:22.680
You don't have to.

03:22.690 --> 03:24.200
That's your personal preference.

03:24.220 --> 03:29.170
I'll select next and then I'm going to click install and it's going to go through the install.

03:29.170 --> 03:30.780
It's a pretty quick install.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.740
You can just run right through this.

03:32.770 --> 03:38.320
Now at this point, we've installed the C plus plus compiler in the previous video and now we've installed

03:38.320 --> 03:40.180
code lite, so we're ready to go.

03:40.210 --> 03:45.820
The next step is to configure code lite to work with the compiler that we've already installed, and

03:45.820 --> 03:47.380
we'll do that in the next video.
