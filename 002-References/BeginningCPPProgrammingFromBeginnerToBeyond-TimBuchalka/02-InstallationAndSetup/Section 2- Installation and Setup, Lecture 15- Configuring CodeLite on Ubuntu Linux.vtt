00:05.190 --> 00:06.300
Hello, everyone.

00:06.300 --> 00:13.380
In this video we're going to configure code light to work with the C plus plus compiler on Ubuntu Linux.

00:13.380 --> 00:16.920
I'm running Ubuntu 22.04, which is jemmy.

00:17.040 --> 00:18.660
I've already opened code light.

00:18.690 --> 00:24.240
The first time you run code light you're going to get a setup wizard pop up window that pops up just

00:24.240 --> 00:24.960
like this.

00:24.990 --> 00:28.890
If you don't get that, you can always go to help and run it from there.

00:29.310 --> 00:32.700
We do want to run this setup wizard, so I want to click next.

00:34.060 --> 00:38.680
I'm going to click See plus Plus development and click next again.

00:39.550 --> 00:44.110
And I'm going to ask Code light to scan my system to find compilers.

00:45.130 --> 00:49.410
I'll click that button and you can see it found GCC 11, which was the compiler that we installed.

00:49.420 --> 00:51.640
Now I'm going to rename that to just GCC.

00:51.670 --> 00:54.930
That way it's consistent throughout the course, but I'll do that in just a moment.

00:54.940 --> 00:56.200
I'll select next.

00:57.050 --> 01:00.980
Here you can choose the color whether you want a dark theme or a light theme.

01:01.010 --> 01:04.640
I generally use a dark theme, but I think the light theme shows up better on video.

01:04.640 --> 01:07.580
So I'm just going to leave this alone and I'll select next.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.160
And on this screen, just click finish.

01:12.360 --> 01:15.570
Okay, so code will close down and open back up.

01:15.900 --> 01:21.540
And now what we want to do is we want to set up the compiler and we're just going to change the name.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.660
So I'm going to come up to settings and go to build settings.

01:24.660 --> 01:27.060
And there you can see GCC right here.

01:27.060 --> 01:31.050
So I'm just going to right click and rename and I'm just going to call it GCC.

01:32.060 --> 01:33.980
Just like that, and I'll hit.

01:33.980 --> 01:34.670
Okay?

01:34.970 --> 01:35.750
Perfect.

01:35.780 --> 01:38.990
Now what we want to do is we want to create workspaces.

01:40.370 --> 01:42.950
The way code light works is it's got workspaces.

01:42.950 --> 01:48.650
And in those workspaces, you can have many projects, each project being a C plus plus program.

01:48.650 --> 01:51.350
So it's a real nice way to organize your work.

01:51.380 --> 01:55.280
The first thing we want to do is we want to create a new workspace.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.870
Now, there's a lot of ways to do that.

01:56.870 --> 01:59.770
I can click this big button right here, right in front of me.

01:59.780 --> 02:05.810
I can also come up to Workspace new Workspace, and I can go to file new workspace over here.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.370
A lot of different ways to do it.

02:07.370 --> 02:09.530
I'm going to just click this button right here.

02:10.630 --> 02:14.620
Now I'm going to select the C plus plus workspace and click okay.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.270
Now it's going to ask me, where do you want to store your workspaces?

02:18.300 --> 02:19.650
You've got some choices here.

02:19.650 --> 02:20.730
You can put them on your desktop.

02:20.730 --> 02:22.460
You can put them in your documents folder.

02:22.470 --> 02:28.050
I'm going to put it right off of my home directory right there, and I'm going to create a folder there.

02:28.560 --> 02:34.920
Let me click over here to create the folder and I'm going to call it workspaces so I can create as many

02:34.920 --> 02:36.390
workspaces as I want in here.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.940
And then projects within each of those workspaces.

02:38.970 --> 02:40.830
And I can have everything nicely organized.

02:40.830 --> 02:44.040
So I'm going to click Create, and I'll hit open.

02:44.040 --> 02:50.790
So now you can see that the workspace path is my home directory, followed by workspaces and the workspace

02:50.790 --> 02:55.320
name is going to be workspace one or whatever you like, what you're working on pointers, maybe you

02:55.320 --> 02:57.720
want a pointers workspace and so forth.

02:57.870 --> 03:02.580
Make sure that the create the workspace under a separate directory is checked and I'm going to click

03:02.580 --> 03:05.220
okay And that will create my workspace.

03:05.220 --> 03:07.470
And you can see it right over here on the Workspace view.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.570
You can see the workspace one.

03:09.780 --> 03:15.090
Now what we want to do is create projects within that workspace so I can right click on the workspace

03:15.190 --> 03:17.290
one and create a new project.

03:17.290 --> 03:20.460
Or I can come up to file new project.

03:20.470 --> 03:22.320
Again, a lot of different ways to do it.

03:22.330 --> 03:25.030
I'm just going to right click here and say new project.

03:25.690 --> 03:28.060
And now we get this new project wizard.

03:28.090 --> 03:31.270
We know that the path is that workspace one folder.

03:31.270 --> 03:32.590
That's where my workspace is now.

03:32.590 --> 03:34.450
It's asking us for the project name.

03:34.450 --> 03:36.760
I'm just going to call it Project One.

03:37.390 --> 03:38.440
Just like that.

03:38.440 --> 03:39.400
Very important.

03:39.400 --> 03:43.150
I'm going to probably say this more times than you want to hear it, but it's very important.

03:43.180 --> 03:47.440
No spaces, no special characters, no international characters anywhere.

03:47.440 --> 03:52.930
So don't start putting plus symbols and dots and slashes and dollar signs in these names because that

03:52.930 --> 03:55.300
will usually mess up the builds later.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.700
So just keep them really, really simple.

03:57.730 --> 04:01.690
Make sure that the create the project in its own folder is checked.

04:01.840 --> 04:08.320
Now the category we're going to select is console because we're going to be creating console based applications.

04:08.350 --> 04:13.240
The type is going to be simple executable, G plus plus right here.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.530
The compiler is GCC.

04:16.560 --> 04:19.170
That's the one we just installed and renamed.

04:20.240 --> 04:23.180
The debugger is the GNU gdb debugger.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.620
We only have one option here.

04:25.220 --> 04:26.720
And the build system.

04:26.720 --> 04:27.650
We've got two options.

04:27.650 --> 04:30.470
We're going to select code light, make file generator.

04:30.590 --> 04:33.980
I'm installing version 17.3 of code light.

04:33.980 --> 04:36.710
Previous versions had a default build system.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.900
It was called default and it worked great.

04:38.900 --> 04:44.450
But in this version and going forward, the code light developer removed that default build system.

04:44.660 --> 04:47.300
I don't know why I did that, but we have to deal with it.

04:47.300 --> 04:50.120
So we'll make a few adjustments to the way we create new projects.

04:50.120 --> 04:55.730
But it's pretty easy once we have all that, make sure all this is correct, you click okay and you

04:55.730 --> 05:01.160
can see now that we've got a new project over here, Project One, and it's got a source folder and

05:01.160 --> 05:03.740
it's got my main.cpp file in it.

05:03.770 --> 05:07.220
The Main.cpp file is our source code.

05:07.460 --> 05:11.750
Now I'm going to make this a little bit bigger, so I'm going to go to settings, colors and fonts,

05:11.750 --> 05:16.070
and I'm just going to create maybe a let's see.

05:17.220 --> 05:18.420
We can set that to 20.

05:18.450 --> 05:19.500
That should be nice and big.

05:19.500 --> 05:23.880
So it shows up good on video and I'll select that and apply and then hit.

05:23.880 --> 05:24.570
Okay.

05:25.110 --> 05:25.410
All right.

05:25.410 --> 05:27.240
So now the font is nice and large.

05:27.240 --> 05:30.090
So first thing we're going to do is we're going to delete this.

05:30.100 --> 05:32.340
I'm just going to copy it all and just press delete.

05:33.400 --> 05:33.570
Okay.

05:33.630 --> 05:39.570
Now you can see over here you have this black dot that's telling you that this file has been changed.

05:39.570 --> 05:42.270
So what's on disk is different from what you're seeing.

05:42.270 --> 05:44.700
Makes sense because we just deleted a bunch of stuff.

05:44.700 --> 05:49.320
So we want to be sure that whenever we see that, we save when we're done.

05:49.320 --> 05:53.350
So first thing we're going to do is we're going to type in a real simple Hello world.

05:53.370 --> 05:54.780
C plus plus program.

05:54.810 --> 05:57.690
The reason we do this is because it's simple.

05:57.690 --> 06:03.030
And if it runs and we see Hello World, we know that our development environment is set up correctly.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.250
So that's the reason for doing it at this point.

06:05.250 --> 06:09.570
Just type along, follow along all the C plus plus will be explained later.

06:09.600 --> 06:13.710
The point of this video is to make sure that our development environment is set up correctly.

06:13.710 --> 06:24.970
So I'm going to type pound, include add space, left angle bracket I o stream and right angle bracket.

06:24.970 --> 06:31.600
Then I'm going to type using namespace std semicolon.

06:31.630 --> 06:36.850
There's spaces between using and the namespace and namespace and standard.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.760
Now I want to write my main function.

06:39.760 --> 06:43.990
Every C plus plus program has a main function and that's where execution begins.

06:43.990 --> 06:44.860
So let's do that.

06:44.860 --> 06:51.550
We'll type int, int space, main left, parentheses right per end.

06:51.550 --> 06:57.670
And then we have an open curly brace and you'll notice that code light automatically closed the right

06:57.670 --> 06:58.870
curly brace for me.

06:58.870 --> 07:00.160
So that way they match.

07:00.190 --> 07:03.370
Make sure you spell main correctly, Make sure those are parentheses.

07:03.370 --> 07:06.760
Make sure you've got spaces where I have spaces and so forth.

07:07.240 --> 07:14.080
Okay, so now I'm just going to tab over and I'm going to type C out to left angle brackets side by

07:14.080 --> 07:17.890
side, no space between them and hello world.

07:21.310 --> 07:26.590
And I want that within double quotes to left angle brackets again.

07:26.590 --> 07:29.990
And then the word e n d l for end line.

07:30.010 --> 07:33.100
Make sure that's e n d l and not END1.

07:33.130 --> 07:34.960
The l and the one look really similar.

07:35.140 --> 07:39.070
Then I'm going to return space zero and a semicolon.

07:39.370 --> 07:40.300
That's it.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.890
That's our simple main.

07:41.890 --> 07:45.250
When we run it, we should see Hello World display on the terminal.

07:45.340 --> 07:50.070
But before we run it, we need to configure this project and give it a few compiler settings.

07:50.080 --> 07:55.870
First thing though, is let's save this so you can come up here to file save file, or you can press

07:55.870 --> 07:56.560
control S.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.430
I'm going to press control.

07:57.430 --> 08:00.250
S and you can see that black dot is gone.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.960
It might be a red dot on your system.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.660
It was a red dot in my other system, but it's a black dot here.

08:04.660 --> 08:08.140
In any case, you're going to see that dot there when the file is dirty.

08:08.140 --> 08:11.950
In other words, when it hasn't been saved, when I've made some changes, but I haven't saved them

08:11.950 --> 08:12.880
to disk yet.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.820
Okay, so now let's set up the project.

08:15.820 --> 08:19.780
I'm going to right click on the project and select settings.

08:19.780 --> 08:26.960
You can also just click on the project and select this wrench Right up here does the same thing At this

08:26.960 --> 08:27.560
point.

08:27.560 --> 08:32.360
My project Settings window opens and let's go through this.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.070
The project type is executable.

08:34.070 --> 08:37.040
The Makefile generator is code light, Makefile generator.

08:37.070 --> 08:40.940
The compiler is GCC, the intermediate directory is blank.

08:40.970 --> 08:47.120
The output file says project name and sometimes you need to stretch this out just a little bit to see

08:47.120 --> 08:48.310
more stuff.

08:48.320 --> 08:52.820
And I think that doesn't happen on the on Windows or Mac, but it does happen on Linux sometimes.

08:52.820 --> 08:54.470
Let me stretch that out a little bit.

08:54.470 --> 08:57.050
So all of this is the stuff that we put in earlier.

08:57.050 --> 09:01.340
There's one thing that's really important is this one right here, the working directory.

09:01.370 --> 09:11.870
We want to delete that the entire line and we want to replace it with dollar left parentheses project

09:11.870 --> 09:17.930
path right parentheses where the P in project and the P in path are uppercase.

09:18.080 --> 09:19.220
That's really important.

09:19.370 --> 09:19.760
Okay.

09:19.760 --> 09:20.660
That's the first part.

09:20.690 --> 09:25.970
The second part is I'm going to come over here to my compiler, click compiler, and right up here where

09:25.970 --> 09:27.710
it says Cplusplus compiler.

09:27.710 --> 09:32.630
I'm going to click that line and you can see these little button shows up with three dots in it.

09:32.630 --> 09:33.950
I'm going to click that.

09:34.610 --> 09:40.790
Then I'm going to come over here and the compiler options and I want to choose enable C plus plus 17

09:40.790 --> 09:41.300
features.

09:41.300 --> 09:48.620
This one right here enable C plus plus 17 features stood equals C plus plus 17 that will tell code light

09:48.650 --> 09:51.590
to use the C plus plus version of the compiler.

09:51.620 --> 09:52.880
That's it, We're done.

09:52.880 --> 09:57.620
We'll click okay, we'll click apply and we'll click okay one more time.

09:57.620 --> 09:59.300
At this point, we are good to go.

09:59.300 --> 10:04.010
Now I'm going to make this full screen here so that we have a little bit more room to see what's happening.

10:04.010 --> 10:04.520
Now.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.170
We're ready to build our project.

10:06.200 --> 10:11.540
The way that code light works, since it can have multiple projects in this workspace here, of course,

10:11.540 --> 10:12.620
we only have one right now.

10:12.620 --> 10:14.450
We'll create another one in just a moment.

10:14.600 --> 10:20.780
It builds and runs the active project and you can see the active project right there.

10:20.780 --> 10:23.060
It's bold and it's italicized.

10:23.060 --> 10:27.650
So if I have a bunch of projects, there's only going to be one that's bold and italicized, and that's

10:27.650 --> 10:31.070
considered the active project to make a project.

10:31.070 --> 10:36.780
The active project, you can select it right click on it, and then come down here to make active,

10:36.780 --> 10:38.550
or you could just double click on it.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.700
Simple as that.

10:40.730 --> 10:46.040
Now we're ready to build this, so we're going to come up to build and I'm going to select Rebuild Project,

10:46.040 --> 10:51.140
and I'll talk about all of the differences here in a future video, I'm going to select Rebuild Project,

10:51.470 --> 10:54.200
and the output window shows up down at the bottom.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.160
I stretch this out.

10:55.310 --> 10:59.840
It's a little bit bigger and you can see right here we're using the C plus plus compiler.

10:59.840 --> 11:06.920
We're building Project one Main.cpp We've got stood C plus plus 17 and all the stuff that we typed in.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.150
So this is great.

11:08.180 --> 11:11.500
We have a successful build, no errors, no warnings.

11:11.510 --> 11:13.250
Now I can run my program.

11:13.250 --> 11:16.580
So let me close this up again to give us a little bit more room down there.

11:16.580 --> 11:19.580
And I'm going to go to build and I'm going to select Run.

11:21.190 --> 11:23.910
Do I want to build and execute or just execute?

11:23.920 --> 11:29.500
I've already built it, so I'm just going to execute it and we get a terminal window pop up and it says,

11:29.500 --> 11:34.930
Hello world hit any key to continue the Hello World is our program to hit any key to continue is what

11:34.930 --> 11:39.550
code light puts in there because otherwise it would just display that and close up the window real fast.

11:39.550 --> 11:41.560
So we press any key to continue.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.780
It closes the window and we are done.

11:43.990 --> 11:45.370
So that's it.

11:45.370 --> 11:46.180
Simple as that.

11:46.180 --> 11:47.950
That's the way we organize this.

11:47.980 --> 11:52.870
In a couple of videos from now I'm going to have a video that shows you how to create a project template

11:52.870 --> 11:58.360
so that we don't have to do the stood equals C plus plus 17 part, which saves us a little bit of time.

11:58.630 --> 11:59.260
Great.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.870
So let's create another project.

12:01.870 --> 12:04.900
And the second project is going to be basically the same source code.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.910
Again, close this down down here.

12:06.910 --> 12:09.250
So I'm just going to copy this source code.

12:09.250 --> 12:15.910
I'm going to press control C to copy and I'm going to go to my workspace and I'm going to select right

12:15.910 --> 12:16.540
click.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.280
New project.

12:20.870 --> 12:25.130
I get the same new project Wizard and I'm going to create Project two.

12:25.160 --> 12:30.830
In this case, again, no spaces, no special characters, no international characters.

12:30.860 --> 12:34.340
Make sure that create the project in its own folder is selected.

12:34.370 --> 12:37.250
These settings should carry over from the last time we did this.

12:37.250 --> 12:45.530
So we've got console simple executable g plus plus gcc the gdb debugger and code light makefile generator.

12:45.530 --> 12:46.880
We'll click okay.

12:47.030 --> 12:52.790
And now over here you can see we have project two and it's got a source folder and it's got a main.cpp.

12:52.820 --> 12:56.540
Let me expand these so you can see that they are two distinct projects.

12:56.540 --> 13:00.680
Now if you look up here, you know that this is the source code for Project One.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.480
You can see that right up here in the tab.

13:02.480 --> 13:07.490
And if I double click on this main.cpp, it will open up next to it and that's Project two.

13:07.490 --> 13:14.090
So this is Project One's main, this is Project Two's main, so I'm just going to grab all that and

13:14.090 --> 13:20.370
paste the other one that I copied into it and I'm going to say Hello World from Project two.

13:21.720 --> 13:25.520
Notice the black dot up here, so I'm going to hit Ctrl s to save.

13:25.530 --> 13:27.270
Now I know that I've saved this.

13:27.270 --> 13:28.260
Now we're going to do the same thing.

13:28.260 --> 13:32.730
We're going to set up Project two, so I'm going to click on Project two, click on the Wrench.

13:33.670 --> 13:37.120
And right here, you can always see up here it says Project two settings.

13:37.390 --> 13:40.210
And this really stretched out that time.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.050
There we go.

13:41.050 --> 13:41.970
Let's try that.

13:41.980 --> 13:45.990
So again, General, we're going to come right here to working directory.

13:46.000 --> 13:53.980
I'm going to delete that and I'm going to type dollar project path inside parentheses with the two PS

13:53.980 --> 13:54.970
uppercase.

13:55.920 --> 13:56.640
That's it.

13:56.640 --> 13:58.290
Then I'm going to go to my compiler.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.470
Go to my C plus plus compiler options.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.710
Click that button with the three dots.

14:04.920 --> 14:10.260
Select Enable C plus plus 17 features stood equals C plus plus 17.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.130
Click.

14:11.130 --> 14:11.910
Okay.

14:12.330 --> 14:13.320
Apply.

14:13.350 --> 14:13.800
Click.

14:13.800 --> 14:14.460
Okay.

14:14.490 --> 14:17.610
Now we're ready to build, but we have to wait a second.

14:17.610 --> 14:22.950
We can't just build now because if we build, the active project will be built and that's project one.

14:22.950 --> 14:26.970
You can see here, I don't want to build Project one, I want to build Project two.

14:27.000 --> 14:32.730
So what I can do is I can right click on Project two and make it active, or I could just double click

14:32.730 --> 14:33.330
on it.

14:33.330 --> 14:37.140
And when I double click on it, you can see that it's now the active project.

14:37.170 --> 14:41.820
It's bold and italicized so I can come back up to build.

14:41.970 --> 14:44.970
I can select Rebuild Project.

14:46.190 --> 14:51.860
We have our build output down here and you can see that Project two has been built right here.

14:51.890 --> 14:54.870
We've got all the options we want, so this is a good thing.

14:54.890 --> 14:57.020
I'll close this up and now we're ready to run.

14:57.020 --> 14:59.210
So I'm going to go build and run.

14:59.540 --> 15:00.980
I'm just going to execute.

15:01.220 --> 15:05.660
And now we should say Hello World from Project two, which is exactly what we see.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.310
We can press any key.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.920
I'm just going to press enter to close this down.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.000
So that's it.

15:11.030 --> 15:13.400
We've got our build environment working now.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.990
We can start writing code.

15:15.020 --> 15:18.590
The other thing that I'd like you to do is go up to settings.

15:19.290 --> 15:20.790
And preferences.

15:21.500 --> 15:25.040
And come all the way over here on the right to miscellaneous and just click that.

15:25.040 --> 15:30.800
And in start up right here, there is a check for new version on startup and I want you to uncheck that.

15:31.550 --> 15:34.400
Otherwise it's going to ask you to upgrade to a new version.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.550
Every time there's a new version or a point release.

15:36.560 --> 15:40.490
My advice is to resist the urge to update.

15:40.520 --> 15:46.220
If you've got a working environment that's working and you're able to use it to develop programs, don't

15:46.220 --> 15:47.000
mess around with it.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.170
Just use the same development environment throughout the course.

15:50.180 --> 15:53.450
Sometimes we think that the upgrades are better.

15:53.480 --> 15:58.250
A lot of times upgrades are bleeding edge and they're full of bugs and they're not really worth the

15:58.250 --> 15:58.790
trouble.

15:58.790 --> 16:03.050
So once we've got a working development environment, leave it alone.

16:03.050 --> 16:04.160
It works great.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.360
I'm going to apply.

16:05.390 --> 16:07.550
Click okay and that's it.

16:07.580 --> 16:08.570
We're ready to go.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.430
Our build environment is set up.

16:10.910 --> 16:12.200
One more thing.

16:12.200 --> 16:15.740
When I build, it's possible that we have errors, right?

16:15.770 --> 16:18.560
Of course we can have typos, we can have syntax errors.

16:18.560 --> 16:26.130
So for example, suppose I forgot that semicolon right there I can come up to first I want to save.

16:26.850 --> 16:30.180
And there's the little red arrow there that's telling me there's a problem.

16:30.180 --> 16:32.610
There's expecting a semicolon after namespace.

16:32.610 --> 16:33.990
That's not the compiler.

16:34.020 --> 16:38.070
That's the code Lights IntelliSense, if you will, which is kind of going through our code and looking

16:38.070 --> 16:39.600
at it and trying to help us out.

16:39.690 --> 16:42.300
But if we build, you can see that we have a syntax error.

16:42.300 --> 16:49.890
It says expecting a semicolon before the int and we have an error and our program did not build correctly.

16:49.890 --> 16:52.500
So we don't want to run this program until we fix the error.

16:52.530 --> 16:56.970
There are a lot of errors that we can get and we'll do a whole video on just the kinds of errors that

16:56.970 --> 16:58.140
you'll see common errors.

16:58.140 --> 17:01.800
This is one that's really common is forgetting the semicolon at the end.

17:01.920 --> 17:06.150
A lot of students spell iostream wrong and they put iostream.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.500
So that's a problem.

17:07.500 --> 17:13.260
If we misspell main, you can imagine if we put spaces between these two angle brackets, if we forget

17:13.290 --> 17:15.150
one of these parentheses.

17:15.150 --> 17:17.730
So there's a lot of places the syntax has to be just right.

17:17.730 --> 17:20.640
But again, we'll talk about all of this in the course.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.500
At this point, you're good to go.

17:22.530 --> 17:26.830
If you have any questions or any issues, please post them in the forum.

17:26.830 --> 17:30.430
Look on the forums because just about every question has already been asked and answered.

17:30.430 --> 17:34.630
But if you have a question that's not out there, please post it and I'll be happy to help you.

17:34.660 --> 17:39.640
The next video you should go to in this section is the video that shows how to create a default project

17:39.670 --> 17:40.390
template.

17:40.390 --> 17:41.650
So I'll see you there.
