00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.600
In this video, I'd like to go over the content in this section of the course.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.860
This is a very important section since we described the installation

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.260
of the tools necessary to create, build and execute C++

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.060
programs.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.620
We wanted to make this course accessible to as many students as possible

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.620
who want to learn C++.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.820
So if you're running Microsoft windows,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.420
macOS 10 or ubuntu Linux,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.820
we have videos detailing the steps necessary to get up and running on your platform.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.420
The following section includes videos for installing the C++

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.420
compiler and the CodeLite IDE on specific

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.620
operating systems.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.580
Then we show you how to configure CodeLite,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.380
so that it's using the C++ compiler we just installed.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.940
Then we'll go over how to create a default CodeLite project template

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.240
that you can use when you need to create new C++ projects.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.300
This will make it very easy to start new projects quickly

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.900
since all the required settings will be ready to go.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.460
In all the videos, we use a very simple C++ program

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.960
to test the installations.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.950
All the elements of the C++ program will be explained in detail

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.650
as we progress through the course.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.630
In this section, just type in the program and follow along to ensure your

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.130
installation is complete.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.030
In addition to using the CodeLite IDE,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.030
we want to be sure that students can learn and build C++ programs

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.430
even though they may not be able to install an IDE due to hardware limitations.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.480
So we created a section that uses just a simple text editor

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.780
and the command line tools to do just that.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.280
If you're unable to use an IDE,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.400
then please don't let that stop you from learning C++.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.900
You can still use the command line just fine.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.560
Finally, we'll look at a few websites that have C++ compilers

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.920
available that you can use to write and execute

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.820
basic C++ programs.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.020
This has some limitations

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.020
but it's great if you're on the road or away from your PC.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.820
All you need is a web browser

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.820
and you can run much of the code presented in this class.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.710
Remember, websites,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.010
software versions and tools change over time.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.310
If there are any changes that are important,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.310
I'll post the information in the resources section

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.810
of the specific videos.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.610
So if a new version of CodeLite is released and it's different from

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.410
the previous version, I'll post an update in the resources section,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.770
explaining how to use the new version.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.770
This allows everyone to carry on using the new version

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.270
while new videos are recorded and uploaded.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.970
Okay. So go to the videos that apply to your operating system.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.770
We'll get started installing the tools we need to create

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.070
C++ programs. I'll see you there.
