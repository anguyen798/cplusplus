Programming isn't just about getting in front of a computer and writing code.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.200
There are syntax and rules to follow best practices and lots of thought involved.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.010
We also have to learn how to handle errors and know

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.310
what they mean and how to fix them and more.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.660
So we've included quizzes at the end of most of the sections in this course.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.860
The quizzes are for you to see how well you can apply the concepts presented in each section

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.060
and to reinforce the material presented.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.260
Some questions are easy and some are more difficult.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.660
I urge you to go through the quizzes. I think you'll find them challenging but still fun.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.120
Each quiz has 10 questions,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.000
and they're multiple choice and fill in the blank type questions.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.850
The quizzes are more concept-oriented,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.050
where the section challenge exercises are more code-oriented.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.200
But sometimes the quiz questions may ask you about a specific piece of code

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.800
and what you think it displays.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.700
I hope you find the quizzes as well as the challenge exercises

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.580
useful for your learning experience. Okay, Frank, enough talk.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.580
Let's get started learning c++.
