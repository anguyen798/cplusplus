00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.400
In this video, I'd like to take a few minutes and talk about the challenge

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.000
exercises in this course.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.100
Most sections of the course will have a challenge exercise

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.560
that you can attempt to solve.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.760
The challenges will range from simple at the beginning of the course

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.760
to very, very challenging toward the end of the course.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.760
These challenges are programming challenges

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.760
in which you'll typically be given a description of the challenge

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.960
and the project files to start you off.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.620
In addition to the challenge description,

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.920
I'll also explain the challenge in video

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.120
and walk you through the expected output.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.320
These challenges are a great opportunity for you to apply what you've learned in each section

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.420
and code a c++ solution that works and solves the challenge.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.050
Once you complete the challenge, you can watch a video

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.050
of my solution to the challenge so you can compare to your own.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.850
Remember there are many, many ways to solve the same problem

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.850
and my solution is just one way,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.210
but it will provide a solution to the same problem that you can learn from.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.810
I encourage you to make up self-challenges as well.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.310
The more code you write and the more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.310
c++ and the better your code will become.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.970
It's okay if you can't fully complete the challenge.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.970
They're not called challenges for nothing.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.970
Do the challenges at your own pace. No pressure,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.570
have fun, experiment, and keep trying even if you get frustrated.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.170
Before you know you'll be solving complex

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.970
problems and creating your own object-oriented programs.
