00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.600
In this section,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.220
we'll talk about keywords, identifiers,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.220
punctuation operators and syntax in programming languages.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.520
Most languages have keywords.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.020
Keywords are part of the vocabulary of a programming language

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.020
in most languages. The keywords are also reserved.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.220
This means that you, the programmer,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.210
cannot redefine their meaning and you can't use them in a way in which there were not intended.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.870
C++ has lots of keywords

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.570
in a browser. I've opened up a webpage for CPP reference.com

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.770
that lists the C++ keywords

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.370
without a frame of reference. It's difficult to know that this is a lot of keywords.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.370
There are around 90 keywords in C++.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.470
Java has around 50 --

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.970
has 32 and Python has 33.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.570
90 is a lot of keywords.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.230
Now in general, the more keywords that a language has,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.730
the more complex the programming language grammar.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.690
However, there are many keywords in C++ that are rarely used.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.690
I've been using C++ for a very long time.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.190
And there are some keywords in this list that I've never used.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.290
There's no need to sit down and memorize all these keywords.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.290
We'll use the keywords as we need them. You'll learn that along the way.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.090
Notice that some of the keywords in this list we've already used. For example,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.390
we've used it and we've used return. Here and here's

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.790
return right here.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.690
We use that in our first program.Also noticed that pound include

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.990
main, favorite number, standard endline,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.990
cin and cout are not in this list.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.850
That's because they're not keywords. We'll talk about them. Next.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.980
What's important to remember here

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.240
is that C++ has a set of keywords that it's defined in the language.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.040
And these words are reserved.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.340
Now let's go to code light and see the reserve words in our first program.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.040
Back in code light. And I'm looking at the same program that we did in the previous section.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.440
The moment, the favorite number, you can see that I mentioned that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.240
main and pound include

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.940
and favorite number and so forth.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.440
We're not keywords. Same with standard out,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.190
see out and so forth and inline all of these.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.850
These are not keywords. These are called identifiers.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.650
And there's an important distinction between identifiers and keywords

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.950
and identifier is something that the programmer names.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.450
So these names have been created by programmers

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.650
to create something that represents something meaningful to them.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.300
There are rules about how to name identifiers and we'll go into all those in a later section C++

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.600
also has operators has got a lot of operators.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.700
It's got the operators that you used to, you know, your addition,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.700
multiplication, subtraction, division, and so forth.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.560
But in this case, we're using some non-standard operators,for example.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.560
This guy right here, that little Chevron

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.360
is the stream insertion operator.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.020
We're going to insert whatever's on the right-hand side of it, into that stream.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.420
In this case, it's an output stream that gets displayed to the console.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.120
Same thing with the string extraction operator.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.120
One takes something from the console and stores it into a variable

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.890
in this case.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.890
Favorite number

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.790
there's also that double colon right here.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.990
That's the scope resolution operator.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.860
We'll talk about all of these operators as we go on to section nine in the course,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.760
C++ also has punctuation

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.260
things like semi-colons at the end of statements, curlies

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.160
open and closed quotes, parentheses.It's got all kinds of punctuation.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.760
When you put all of these elements together in a program,

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.360
you end up with something called syntax.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.960
Syntax is the syntax of the programming language, the structure,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.960
and the meaning of what you want the compiler to understand

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.120
the compiler is taking your code and translating it to machine code.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.980
And it's translating it based on what you told that you wanted to be done.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.780
It's not going to guess. This may sound a little intimidating at this point,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.140
but it comes pretty quickly with a little bit of practice.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.340
Well, that completes this video in the next video.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.740
We'll talk about the seatbelt plus preprocessor

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.140
and we'll learn more about that.Pre-processor directive pound include.
