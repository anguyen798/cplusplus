00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.700
In this section of the course, we'll take a look at the basic structure

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.300
of a simple c++ program.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.150
First, we'll look at the basic components of a c++ program.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.150
These includes things like keywords,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.550
identifiers, operators, punctuation, comments and syntax.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
Then we'll discuss the pre-processor directives that c++ uses.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.610
These are the statements that begin with the pound sign or the hashtag.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160
And we'll discuss what they do and how they work.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.810
We'll then take a look at the main function specifically and functions in general.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.010
Then we'll discuss what c++ namespaces are

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.010
and why we use the standard namespace so often.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.010
That's the STD word reviews throughout.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.910
Weâ€™ll then learn about the types of comments that c++ supports

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.910
and why we use comments in our code at all.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.770
Finally, we'll talk about basic stream input output using cin and cout.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.870
Let's get started.
