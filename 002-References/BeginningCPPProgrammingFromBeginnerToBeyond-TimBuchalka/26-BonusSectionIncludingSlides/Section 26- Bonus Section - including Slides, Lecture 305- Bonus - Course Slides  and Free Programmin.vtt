00:01.190 --> 00:05.730
Congratulations on getting to the last video in the beginning, C++ course.

00:05.750 --> 00:06.890
That's a huge course.

00:06.890 --> 00:08.100
So it's a huge achievement.

00:08.120 --> 00:10.010
Congratulations for finishing the course.

00:10.490 --> 00:15.710
This video is designed to show you how to get some free, valuable programming information into your

00:15.710 --> 00:16.640
hands today.

00:16.790 --> 00:19.140
Firstly, I want to talk about the course slides.

00:19.160 --> 00:21.140
We're making these available for download.

00:21.470 --> 00:24.800
There's a huge amount of slides comprising 600 plus pages.

00:24.830 --> 00:28.190
You'll get access to those for free and I'll tell you how in this video.

00:28.220 --> 00:31.820
Secondly, I'm going to point you to another course about learning to code.

00:31.940 --> 00:33.170
This one's on YouTube.

00:33.890 --> 00:38.120
It's different to the courses that I and Frank have been producing on Udemy, because it's designed

00:38.120 --> 00:43.370
to help you understand how programming works by showing how computers work under the hood.

00:43.520 --> 00:49.400
So I'm talking right down to circuits and switches, how the hardware works and how computers use binary

00:49.400 --> 00:53.420
and talk in only one language machine code, things of that nature, which you wouldn't normally learn

00:53.420 --> 00:54.710
in a particular course.

00:55.040 --> 00:59.840
And that course is designed to teach you that information from a perspective of a programmer, and it's

00:59.840 --> 01:04.550
going to help make you a better programmer long term, because you'll understand more fully how things

01:04.550 --> 01:07.670
work at a hardware level when you're typing in your source code.

01:07.910 --> 01:12.050
I'm also giving a free access to my programmers guide in book format.

01:12.720 --> 01:18.170
The video book goes into detail, answering some very common questions that come up for your programming

01:18.170 --> 01:23.990
career, and you'll also get 100 related videos, which will go into more detail answering those questions.

01:24.230 --> 01:29.480
The book and videos collectively answer pretty well all the important questions, certainly the majority

01:29.480 --> 01:31.700
of them relating to programming careers.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.120
Now, that's an example of some of the sample questions that I'll answer.

01:35.150 --> 01:37.130
How long does it take to become a developer?

01:37.340 --> 01:39.500
Do you need a degree to make it as a developer?

01:39.800 --> 01:42.860
What's the number one skill you need to have to succeed as a programmer?

01:43.010 --> 01:45.200
Are you too old to become a programmer?

01:45.590 --> 01:48.650
And what other one do you need to be good at math to succeed as a programmer?

01:48.740 --> 01:50.460
That's just a sample of some of the questions.

01:50.460 --> 01:51.520
There's over 100 more.

01:51.530 --> 01:53.900
I believe there's 106 videos as of the date.

01:53.910 --> 01:56.450
I'm recording this video in July 2021.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.510
So you get all the answers to those questions.

01:58.520 --> 02:02.810
And lastly, because I know this video is dragging on a bit, the Learn Programming Academy Channel

02:02.810 --> 02:07.490
has 50 plus other courses here on Udemy, so I'm going to give you the information in a bit of a summary

02:07.490 --> 02:12.200
format on what each of those courses are all about, but also the big discount links so you can get

02:12.200 --> 02:14.030
them at the best possible price as well.

02:14.270 --> 02:16.550
Alright, so how do you access all this free material?

02:16.930 --> 02:18.410
What you need to do is download the e-book.

02:18.410 --> 02:18.920
That's right.

02:18.920 --> 02:22.400
In this lecture that you're watching right now, you need to be locked into a computer.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.970
It probably won't show up if you're on a tablet or a phone to log into a computer.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.120
Then you click on the resources that you can see on the screen.

02:28.130 --> 02:32.750
Now, in this particular lecture, I click on the bonus pdf, which you can see Open It Up.

02:32.770 --> 02:34.100
It's got everything you need to access.

02:34.100 --> 02:38.600
All the information that I've talked about here in this video, if there's any issues downloading the

02:38.600 --> 02:41.660
PDF, contact me, Anita, me and I'll do my best to help you out.

02:41.660 --> 02:44.270
Alright, so download the e-book right now while you remember.

02:44.390 --> 02:45.620
Thanks again for watching.

02:45.650 --> 02:51.110
Congratulations again on completing this course and look forward to hearing about your future programming

02:51.110 --> 02:51.580
success.

02:51.590 --> 02:52.310
Bye for now.
