00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.600
Welcome back. I hope you had fun trying to solve the problem.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.800
I'm sure you did great.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.600
As you noticed in the workspace I created the challenge which just created an empty shell

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.500
for the problem.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.100
And I've also got the challenge solution which has my solution to the problem.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.160
Okay. So let's start looking at the code here.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.660
We know what we had to solve.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.560
So let's look at some of these really simple statements first.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.160
And I'll mark this up just so it's easier for you to follow.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.260
So in this case, I'm simply outputting welcome

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.260
then I've defined a variable here which is going to hold small rooms.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.860
And I've initialized to 0, that's the best practice. I'm prompting the user.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.150
And I'm asking them to put in the number of small rooms they want cleaned.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.050
I'm doing exactly the same thing here except we're doing large rooms.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.050
And now we've got to define 2 declared constants right.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.850
We're going to declare one is the price for a small room

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.050
and one is the price for a large room, 25 and 35, respectively.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.050
We've got our sales tax declared constant here, and we've got our estimate

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:07.550
expiry constant.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.050
So far so good. It's exactly the same as we did before.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.450
The only thing is I'm adding the large rooms.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.450
Okay. So let me clear this and I'll scroll up just a little bit

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.250
and let's take a look at some of the calculations.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.150
Here are some of the output statements,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.250
and you can see here I'm as I'm outputting the number of small rooms which is just

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.050
whatever the user typed in and the number of large rooms which is whatever they typed in.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.450
The price per small room and the price per large room right here,

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.550
those are our declared constants which I'm outputting. Now the cost.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.250
The calculation is really simple it's the cost of the small rooms plus the cost of the large rooms,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.050
and we calculate each one by

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.050
price per small room times the number of small rooms

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.050
plus and there's my plus sign. Remember you can split these across lines so you can

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.650
line up the insertion operators like that it makes them nice and easy to read.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.640
So in this case, I'm just calculating the cost for the small rooms, and I'm adding

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.140
the cost of the large rooms to it.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.340
Same thing with tax. I'm calculating the cost again.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.140
And I'm multiplying the whole thing by sales tax.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.800
Notice that I've got those parentheses here because what I want to do is

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.790
I want to calculate the whole cost

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.290
and then multiply that by the sales tax. Otherwise,

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.390
I won't get the correct answer.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.090
Got to make sure the whole thing is here.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.480
So this becomes all the small costs plus all the large costs.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.770
Okay. Then finally, the total estimate just takes the cost

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.070
and adds the sales tax to it. That's it.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.670
The estimate is valid for 30 days and there's my program.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.570
So you can see that

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.670
my formatting is probably going to be a little bit different from your formatting,

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.470
and mine might be a little bit more readable.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.070
But you may not have split things across lines like I did.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.270
It's real good practice to split these across lines that way you can

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.670
really see what's going on, and it's much, much easier to follow.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.470
Okay. Well, I hope you enjoyed the challenge, and I hope you did well.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.460
Remember, there's a lot of duplicated code here that we're going to clean up as the course progresses.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.960
And this program -- we'll actually modify this program a little bit later

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.960
on when we use functions.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.960
Okay, so that's it for the challenge.
