00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.100
In this section of the course, we'll learn about variables and constants.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.230
It's virtually impossible to write a c++ program without using variables.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.030
Variables are a fundamental concept in programming languages.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.830
First, we're learned what variables are and how to declare them so we can use them.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.830
There are rules for how we name our variables,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.830
and there are also styled issues to discuss as we go along.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.330
Then we'll go over some of the primitive types in c++

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.530
such as integers,

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.030
floating point numbers Booleans and characters.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.490
We'll also learn how to determine how much storage is allocated to variables

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.490
by using the size of operator.

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.690
Then we'll learn about constants, what they are

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.190
and what they're used and why they're so important to keeping our code correct and modifiable.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.790
We'll learn how to declare and use constants, understand literals and constant expressions.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.290
This section is very straightforward and easy to understand.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.890
However, the concepts you'll learn in this section

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.390
service fundamental building blocks in c++ programming

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.750
since nearly every program you ripe will have variables and constants.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.750
Lets get started.
