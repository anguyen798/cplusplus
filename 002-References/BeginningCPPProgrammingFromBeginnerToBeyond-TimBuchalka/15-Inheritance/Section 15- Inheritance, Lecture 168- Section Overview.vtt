00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.049
In this section, we'll learn
about one of the most useful

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.910
features of object-oriented
programming languages, inheritance.

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.229
Conceptually inheritance
is easy to understand.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.680
However, inheritance in
c++ can be very complex.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.090
We'll keep it simple in this section
so that the basics of inheritance in

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.079
c++ are clear and you can have the
foundation to study more advanced

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.870
concepts in more advanced courses.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.050
First, we'll look at what inheritance
is and why it's so useful, think

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.000
reusability, and then we'll discuss
some of the terminology and notations

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.600
used when talking about inheritance.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.740
Aggregation is also a reusability
mechanism, and we'll see the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.889
difference between inheritance
and aggregation since many times

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:49.140
we can use aggregation instead of
inheritance to achieve what we want

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.420
and avoid unnecessary complexity.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.059
Then we'll get into the
syntax of inheritance in c++.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.349
We'll learn how to derive one
class from an existing class

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.460
and discuss the three types of
inheritance provided by c++.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.020
You may recall when we talked
about the public and private class

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.340
access modifiers in section 13.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.910
I mentioned that there
was a third type of access

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.259
modifier name protected.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.910
Well, protected is used in the
context of inheritance, and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.780
we'll see how it can be useful
in that context in this section.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.999
Then we'll look at constructors and
destructors and see how they work when

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.500
we've got inheritance hierarchies.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.880
With inheritance, we can create
new classes that modify the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.699
behavior of their parent classes.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.590
So we'll see how that works
and how it can be useful.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.610
Finally, we'll talk about what class
hierarchies are, and we'll do a short

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.360
introduction to multiple inheritance.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.350
Once we understand the basics of
inheritance in this section, the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.079
next section will really open up
the power of c++ when we talk about

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.780
polymorphism when it's used with
inheritance and polymorphic methods.

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:53.210
So let's head to the next video and
see what inheritance is all about.
