00:00.080 --> 00:06.930
In this video we learn about expressions. expressions are nothing but the formulas. the formulas that

1
00:06.930 --> 00:10.400
we learn in mathematics, how to write them in program.

2
00:10.410 --> 00:15.540
We will learn this. see after knowing date types and the variables this is the very first thing that you

3
00:15.540 --> 00:17.190
should learn.

4
00:17.250 --> 00:22.950
You should be able to perfectly write down the formula  so that it gets correct results, that is important

5
00:23.330 --> 00:26.930
so for  writing any formula in the form of expression in our program.

6
00:26.940 --> 00:28.450
What are the things that you should know.

7
00:28.830 --> 00:30.540
Let us learn. see

8
00:30.570 --> 00:34.410
We have already studied about arithmetic operators in the previous video.

9
00:34.770 --> 00:40.080
So those arithmetic operators are addition subtraction multiplication division and mod. 

10
00:40.080 --> 00:40.500
Along with that.

11
00:40.500 --> 00:42.840
I have also taken brackets here.

12
00:42.840 --> 00:50.190
Now there is something called precedence of operator precedence means the priority weightage, higher weightage

13
00:50.200 --> 00:50.860
age.

14
00:50.940 --> 00:52.640
So that is higher or lower.

15
00:52.740 --> 00:54.420
Precedence of operators.

16
00:54.510 --> 00:57.060
We are not looking at all the operators in C++.

17
00:57.060 --> 00:58.530
We are looking at only a few.

18
00:58.530 --> 01:00.900
So I have to make them in the form of a table.

19
01:00.960 --> 01:06.300
Assume that the precedence of this one is one and the precedence for multiplication division and mod

20
01:06.300 --> 01:09.340
For all of them is 2 and this bracket is

21
01:09.370 --> 01:09.970
3.

22
01:09.990 --> 01:16.320
So these numbers the shows that brackets are having highest precedence an addition subtraction is having

23
01:16.320 --> 01:19.930
lower precedence among arithmetic operators.

24
01:20.280 --> 01:23.630
Know how these precedence effect, let us understand that.

25
01:23.960 --> 01:28.380
So I will simply write on one formula then, I will show you, I will write the formula here

26
01:28.380 --> 01:37.760
Suppose I am saying x assign with a plus b multiplied by  c minus d slash e.

27
01:37.920 --> 01:39.690
This is the formula I have written.

28
01:39.990 --> 01:44.340
Now in this formula which operator gets executed first.

29
01:44.790 --> 01:49.150
Let us learn this so that actually depends on precedence of operator.

30
01:49.470 --> 01:54.720
So how many operations I have used here addition subtraction multiplication division four operations

31
01:54.730 --> 01:55.800
I have used here.

32
01:55.830 --> 02:00.240
Now who is having higher precedence multiplication and division not having higher precedence.

33
02:00.510 --> 02:05.290
So in this expression both are there, multiplication is also there division is also there.

34
02:05.460 --> 02:11.640
Then which one will get executed first C from the left hand side it will get left to right 

35
02:11.640 --> 02:14.580
it will take so the first one executed is this one.

36
02:15.000 --> 02:16.530
And next is this one.

37
02:17.070 --> 02:18.700
So first it will multiply.

38
02:18.960 --> 02:20.160
Then it will divide.

39
02:20.250 --> 02:27.540
It means who will get multiplied B and C will get multiplied right then D divided by E.

40
02:27.870 --> 02:30.070
So this is how they are executed.

41
02:30.170 --> 02:34.950
Then after that the Lower precedence is for addition and subtraction.

42
02:35.100 --> 02:36.030
they get executed.

43
02:36.060 --> 02:36.950
So we have both.

44
02:37.110 --> 02:38.990
Which one will get executed first.

45
02:39.000 --> 02:40.580
So again left to right.

46
02:40.590 --> 02:45.210
See this left to right is actually called as associativity, so the associated is with

47
02:45.210 --> 02:51.390
Left to Right. we will learn about associativity some other time so left to right is the associativity.

48
02:51.510 --> 02:54.950
So first this one gets executed then this one.

49
02:55.020 --> 03:02.040
So this addition this will add what a with the result of b and c because already they are multiplied

50
03:02.040 --> 03:08.250
already we have the result then this will subtract what 4th one, this the

51
03:08.250 --> 03:10.970
whole left hand side and the right hand side.

52
03:11.040 --> 03:13.040
This is already done, addition is done.

53
03:13.170 --> 03:15.150
So this whole thing and then this one.

54
03:15.240 --> 03:20.550
So this is how depending on the precedence the operation are performed.

55
03:20.620 --> 03:26.530
Next suppose you wanted in some other way. what? you wanted

56
03:26.520 --> 03:29.620
That a plus b should be done first.

57
03:29.640 --> 03:33.510
Then it should be multiplied by C then it should not be written like this.

58
03:33.510 --> 03:35.050
Let us see how to do that.

59
03:35.170 --> 03:37.670
C Again I will write down this expression.

60
03:37.740 --> 03:43.040
A plus B multiplied by C minus d slash e.

61
03:43.330 --> 03:47.740
Suppose in this one I don't want b to be multiplied with c I want a plus b to be multiplied.

62
03:47.760 --> 03:53.890
now in this case because the precedence of this one is Lower.

63
03:54.000 --> 04:01.090
I have to increase this precedence by including in brackets so include this in bracket so that's how we 

64
04:01.120 --> 04:06.450
use precedence now you see who is having highest precedence in the expression.

65
04:06.450 --> 04:07.960
This bracket is having.

66
04:08.010 --> 04:11.280
So whatever it is there in the bracket that will get executed first.

67
04:11.640 --> 04:16.100
Similarly I don't want this d to be divided by E.

68
04:16.200 --> 04:20.730
I want this C minus d   to be divided by e then put it in the bracket.

69
04:20.740 --> 04:24.230
Now it will be perfect, as per you want.

70
04:24.240 --> 04:30.330
How the result you want you have to put them in the brackets so bracket is a very powerful tool for writing

71
04:30.420 --> 04:31.210
expression.

72
04:31.530 --> 04:38.150
So if you know how the precedence and you want them to be executed according to precedence it's okay.

73
04:38.190 --> 04:42.250
No you want to change it then you can change it by imposing brackets.

74
04:42.270 --> 04:44.050
So this is there in mathematics also.

75
04:44.220 --> 04:49.290
Same thing is used here now for learning this one for practicing this one.

76
04:49.290 --> 04:51.360
I have taken some formulas.

77
04:51.410 --> 04:56.910
I will show how to convert  this formulas in expressions of C++ program.

78
04:56.990 --> 04:59.870
then later we will be writing programs on this one also.

79
05:00.440 --> 05:06.390
So let us write on expression for the formulas. let us look at the formula see the first formula is

80
05:06.830 --> 05:08.420
area of triangle.

81
05:08.730 --> 05:15.890
You should be knowing the formula is half into base and  height how to write this in C++ program.

82
05:15.930 --> 05:25.320
If you are using this formula so that expressions should be written like this a is assignment with half

83
05:25.350 --> 05:26.910
you cannot write like this.

84
05:26.910 --> 05:33.360
C If I write half then division means that slash then two.

85
05:33.810 --> 05:40.240
So you know this is integer, 1 and two, both are integer and 1 divided by 2  is 0.

86
05:40.410 --> 05:42.050
So you cannot write like this.

87
05:42.090 --> 05:42.920
This would be wrong.

88
05:43.110 --> 05:52.650
So the first thing we learn then next first write base into height, so base into height where is into sign?.

89
05:52.700 --> 05:58.230
In mathematics we understand that if nothing is there in between multiplication is there but in C++ program

90
05:58.260 --> 05:59.670
you cannot leave it like that.

91
05:59.670 --> 06:07.020
You have to write down into * (multiplication) base * height is written first then this thing if you

92
06:07.020 --> 06:09.150
want to you can enclose in bracket if you want.

93
06:09.170 --> 06:12.810
Otherwise no need because after that division will be done.

94
06:12.810 --> 06:16.510
So this is the perfect formula base into height.

95
06:16.530 --> 06:18.200
whole divided by two.

96
06:19.260 --> 06:25.800
If you say no, as per the formula that is one by two I want to write down that first then write like

97
06:25.800 --> 06:27.200
this right.

98
06:27.210 --> 06:34.610
Point five point five then multiplied by base in to height.

99
06:34.950 --> 06:38.370
So point five multiplied by Base into height.

100
06:38.360 --> 06:39.330
This will be perfect.

101
06:39.660 --> 06:44.250
But remember as this is written float then the result will be float.

102
06:44.250 --> 06:50.400
So you must have this variable as float and here also after dividing it by 2 you may be getting float

103
06:50.400 --> 06:55.830
results so you have to declare this area as float. how to convert this into program we will be learning it

104
06:56.130 --> 07:02.020
but little bit idea I will give you they must have these variables in the our program a b and h.

105
07:02.040 --> 07:07.000
We should be knowing what is b and h then we can use this formula to cal. a, so we will write a 

106
07:07.000 --> 07:10.190
program for this one afterwards in the coming videos.

107
07:10.230 --> 07:12.440
Now let us move on to the next formula.

108
07:12.510 --> 07:16.770
See the next formula is perimeter of a rectangle.

109
07:17.560 --> 07:23.760
p is 2 into a plus b means 2 into length into breadth. so how to write down this one

110
07:25.350 --> 07:34.080
I will remove this. p is a perimeter. perimeter assign 2 into l plus b, into, see in mathematics again.

111
07:34.100 --> 07:42.570
We don't write into but here you must write in to lenght into breadth see if I don't give brackets.

112
07:42.590 --> 07:44.270
Then what happens.

113
07:44.270 --> 07:46.820
see in mathematics also we write bracket .

114
07:46.970 --> 07:49.610
So here if I don't give, then what will happen?

115
07:49.700 --> 07:56.610
It will be multiplied two into length and only length is multiplied by two and then B is added.

116
07:56.660 --> 08:01.070
Actually the formula is l and b should be added then it should be multiplied by 2.

117
08:01.250 --> 08:04.250
Or else you multiply both of them with the two.

118
08:04.270 --> 08:05.360
So this is better.

119
08:05.420 --> 08:09.250
So I should write down this in the bracket right.

120
08:09.440 --> 08:14.360
If you write in the bracket then they are added first because who is having higher precedence, brackets are

121
08:14.390 --> 08:17.370
having higher precedence or this addition will be done first.

122
08:17.510 --> 08:21.280
Whatever it is then the bracket that is done first then it is multiplied by 2.

123
08:21.530 --> 08:22.910
Now the next formula.

124
08:22.970 --> 08:23.980
Sum of n terms.

125
08:23.980 --> 08:24.560
...

126
08:24.560 --> 08:25.560
That is sum of first natural no.s

127
08:25.580 --> 08:30.610
that is s is equal to n into n plus 1 by 2.

128
08:30.610 --> 08:31.920
how to write down this one

129
08:31.970 --> 08:41.000
Let us write it sum s assign n into n plus one by two, we know very well now n plus one .

130
08:41.000 --> 08:45.800
This must be in brackets right first n plus one should be done then it should be multiplied with n

131
08:46.310 --> 08:47.670
then by two.

132
08:47.670 --> 08:54.250
This is how we write in mathematics but in C++ program you have to use this symbol. slash to.

133
08:54.710 --> 08:56.710
So does the simple one.

134
08:56.710 --> 09:03.090
And here s assign n into n plus one by two.

135
09:03.240 --> 09:09.830
Now the next formula nth term of A.P series that is for arithmetic progression series if you know the

136
09:10.190 --> 09:16.220
first term and the common difference then you can find nth term of ap series

137
09:16.220 --> 09:17.320
so that is the formula.

138
09:17.360 --> 09:19.780
t=a+(n-1)d

139
09:19.850 --> 09:29.750
Let us write it in the form of expression t assign a plus a plus n minus one this one inside

140
09:29.790 --> 09:32.540
bracket into D.

141
09:32.540 --> 09:38.830
This is the formula now coming to the next formula root of quadratic equation.

142
09:38.840 --> 09:40.310
This is little lengthy formula.

143
09:40.730 --> 09:41.900
Let us write it.

144
09:42.080 --> 09:50.390
see fr assigned  minus B okay minus B only one root I'm taking it is plus or minus.

145
09:50.450 --> 09:57.260
So we will take just plus the square root of B squared minus four AC B squared.

146
09:57.260 --> 09:58.400
How do you write B squared.

147
09:58.860 --> 10:02.210
So there is no symbol for square or power.

148
10:02.210 --> 10:05.720
Symbol is not that in C++ but that is a function of a level.

149
10:05.780 --> 10:10.750
I'll show you afterwards so I will write B squared as B into B.

150
10:10.830 --> 10:21.940
so write B into B right then minus 4 into a into c.

151
10:21.960 --> 10:24.860
Yes this is perfect.

152
10:24.860 --> 10:29.050
Now this whole thing has to be in square root.

153
10:29.090 --> 10:30.870
How do you find Square root.

154
10:30.990 --> 10:32.230
see for square root

155
10:32.270 --> 10:38.690
There is a header file available in C++ which is having square root function and that header file name

156
10:38.780 --> 10:40.460
as Cmath.

157
10:40.520 --> 10:53.370
So you can see hash include cMath  or else you can also write harsh include Math.h  whatever

158
10:53.390 --> 10:54.120
one you like.

159
10:54.120 --> 10:55.190
You can use it.

160
10:55.210 --> 10:56.440
This is in C++.

161
10:56.440 --> 11:02.740
This was there in C language so you can use the c like things in C++ also if you want you can write this

162
11:02.870 --> 11:05.240
or cmath is a better option.

163
11:05.290 --> 11:13.290
So that header file that library is having all the mathematical functions like Square root, log exponent

164
11:13.400 --> 11:21.220
cos, sin rsin rcos rtan by various function power function various functions are available

165
11:21.290 --> 11:25.690
who can use those mathematical functions in your program.

166
11:25.690 --> 11:30.280
Now knowing about those functions slowly you can learn about them at once you don't have to learn all

167
11:30.280 --> 11:33.700
of them so slowly as in when we are using we'll be learning about them.

168
11:34.000 --> 11:40.180
But right now we want just square root  so there is a function called sqrt in short for square root

169
11:40.480 --> 11:43.760
so that we have to perform up on this whole thing right.

170
11:43.780 --> 11:44.800
This whole thing.

171
11:44.800 --> 11:47.520
So this whole thing should be written inside the square root function.

172
11:47.540 --> 11:49.160
So I'll just make a space for this.

173
11:49.420 --> 11:52.230
So this was r assigned minus B plus.

174
11:52.420 --> 11:54.490
This is sqrt.

175
11:54.580 --> 11:55.830
This is a function.

176
11:55.990 --> 11:59.230
sqrt function. so this is a function

177
11:59.440 --> 12:06.290
So square root will be performed on this entire thing and the result will be added that this minus B.

178
12:06.370 --> 12:15.900
Now the last thing remaining divided by two way divided by two Now the interesting thing a.

179
12:16.200 --> 12:19.300
So shall I write in to a yes.

180
12:19.300 --> 12:19.740
This is

181
12:19.740 --> 12:21.060
because it is 2 into a

182
12:21.090 --> 12:25.620
This is two into a.

183
12:25.690 --> 12:32.930
This will be wrong, why, this entire thing should be divided by two right.

184
12:33.150 --> 12:39.640
But if you read this I'll just highlight sqrt result will be divided by two

185
12:39.660 --> 12:40.770
...

186
12:40.860 --> 12:43.010
We want everything should be divided by two.

187
12:43.120 --> 12:45.430
Okay put the bracket here also.

188
12:45.510 --> 12:47.640
So put the bracket here also.

189
12:47.640 --> 12:48.720
This is perfect.

190
12:48.780 --> 12:55.240
The next one this whole thing is divided by two then multiplied by a no.

191
12:55.260 --> 13:01.990
It should be divided by a also so that 2, a should be in bracket.

192
13:02.010 --> 13:05.030
So these two should be multiplied and the result.

193
13:05.070 --> 13:09.220
This  result should divide this entire thing.

194
13:09.240 --> 13:10.630
This is perfect.

195
13:10.800 --> 13:16.800
If I don't give that bracket then it will be taken as into a, a will be come this side.

196
13:17.130 --> 13:22.920
So we don't want into a this a should be in the denominator only so that must be in the bracket.

197
13:22.940 --> 13:24.150
Otherwise we get wrong.

198
13:24.150 --> 13:27.050
this what you have to be careful.

199
13:27.880 --> 13:33.630
Now we have done enough examples, how to write expression, now the same expressions we

200
13:33.630 --> 13:35.320
will use them in the program.

201
13:35.620 --> 13:42.350
So in the following videos will find the program on each of these formulas then one last formula.

202
13:42.420 --> 13:49.640
This one that is speed that is initial speed can be calculated as final velocity square minus

203
13:49.680 --> 13:53.150
initial velocity squared by two into acceleration.

204
13:53.160 --> 13:57.560
So here v square and u squared is used so I can write.

205
13:57.560 --> 13:59.560
V into v or u into u.

206
13:59.760 --> 14:02.130
Otherwise I can use a power function.

207
14:02.130 --> 14:11.220
So let us use that both the methods we will follow, first method  speed s is assigned v into v ok

208
14:11.220 --> 14:13.060
v into v, minus

209
14:13.150 --> 14:20.630
u into u, now one thing Do I have to put this in bracket.

210
14:20.640 --> 14:26.580
No need because who is having higher precedence multiplication than multiplication that afterwards subtraction

211
14:26.600 --> 14:27.920
so it will be perfect.

212
14:28.620 --> 14:31.910
If you want to put it in brackets that is very good right.

213
14:32.580 --> 14:34.110
So because of laziness.

214
14:34.110 --> 14:38.850
People don't write brackets properly so if you write everything in brackets that is perfect but too

215
14:38.850 --> 14:45.810
many brackets will make it difficult to read also that is that the reason next by 2a should be

216
14:45.810 --> 14:48.360
done by 2 A.

217
14:48.450 --> 14:50.010
Again you're on the same problem.

218
14:50.010 --> 14:51.940
So we cannot write just 2a.

219
14:51.960 --> 14:55.960
We have to write two into a. ok now we are at the same problem What is that.

220
14:56.100 --> 15:05.490
This a will come in multiplication this whole thing divided by 2 into a into a  means a will come in numerator.

221
15:05.670 --> 15:10.830
No this by 2 should be done on the entire thing so this must be in the bracket First of all.

222
15:11.290 --> 15:13.250
And this is in denominator.

223
15:13.260 --> 15:14.850
So this should also be in the brackets.

224
15:14.860 --> 15:16.030
If they are not in the bracket.

225
15:16.040 --> 15:18.160
Then you get wrong results.

226
15:18.410 --> 15:19.900
The next one more method we have.

227
15:20.370 --> 15:27.600
I told you that you can use power function so use power function pow is the function v comma

228
15:27.620 --> 15:28.130
two.

229
15:28.170 --> 15:32.390
This is V square minus pow function.

230
15:32.490 --> 15:34.120
u ,2 .

231
15:34.200 --> 15:35.080
This is a

232
15:35.160 --> 15:42.570
u square then, this whole thing should be divided by two as well as with a multiplied with it.

233
15:42.750 --> 15:43.980
So that should be in brackett.

234
15:45.670 --> 15:47.850
So this is how you can write down the formulas.

235
15:47.890 --> 15:50.170
We have seen various example formulas.

236
15:50.260 --> 15:55.890
We have just seen how to write on the expression from the formula then how to use it in the program

237
15:55.900 --> 16:00.430
how to build up a complete program that we will learn in following videos.

238
16:00.430 --> 16:07.880
From here onwards make sure whenever you find any formula converted it into C++ expression.

239
16:07.930 --> 16:12.340
So this needs a little practice but this needs little practice.

240
16:12.340 --> 16:13.990
Don't think that you have learned once.

241
16:13.990 --> 16:15.610
Now you can do it every time.

242
16:15.610 --> 16:16.120
No.

243
16:16.230 --> 16:19.370
where ever you find formula write it in C++.

244
16:19.390 --> 16:25.560
OK now next video we will write on the programs using these formulas.

245
16:25.610 --> 16:30.910
So for each I would write a program and show you then we will learn how to convert these things into

246
16:30.910 --> 16:31.900
a complete program.

247
16:32.740 --> 16:34.270
So that's all in this video.
