00:00.420 --> 00:09.420
Let us write our first program in C++ Here I'll start Xcode,  create a new project in Xcode and

1
00:09.520 --> 00:13.750
select this option that command line tool.

2
00:13.950 --> 00:19.020
Then you have to mention some project name that is first is the project name and the language selected

3
00:19.030 --> 00:20.790
is C++.

4
00:20.790 --> 00:26.960
There are other options also available to select C++ then next.

5
00:27.030 --> 00:32.820
So where is supposed to created that so you can set the path here wherever you want to create your project

6
00:33.620 --> 00:36.370
say create.

7
00:36.470 --> 00:43.030
Here are the project files so click on main.cpp you can see that readymade code is given.

8
00:43.020 --> 00:48.340
So it has already generated a piece of code that is executable code.

9
00:48.360 --> 00:57.710
Here are a few comments here  i will remove them i will  remove these panels here.

10
00:57.810 --> 00:59.490
See this command line arguments.

11
00:59.500 --> 01:01.510
These are optional in C++.

12
01:01.500 --> 01:06.720
I would just remove these command line arguments, we will study about these After some time.

13
01:06.790 --> 01:12.520
So here is readily available the hello world program I run this.

14
01:12.550 --> 01:14.700
Let us see what you get.

15
01:15.150 --> 01:16.670
Here's an output window.

16
01:17.100 --> 01:17.600
Yeah.

17
01:17.620 --> 01:18.700
Hello world.

18
01:18.910 --> 01:20.840
The output is given here.

19
01:24.740 --> 01:29.440
Here a std scope resolution is used for accessing C out.

20
01:29.450 --> 01:38.910
So instead of this we can also mention 'using namespace' using namespace std.

21
01:38.910 --> 01:51.110
No I don't have to use a std for using C out object let us run this and check once again that's it.

22
01:51.170 --> 01:52.040
So that is working.

23
01:55.150 --> 01:58.940
the same program I will just modify for adding two numbers.

24
01:58.960 --> 02:04.210
I'll remove these lines and I will write on the code here for adding two numbers.

25
02:04.210 --> 02:09.720
I'll declare a few variables in digit A B and C..

26
02:09.850 --> 02:12.070
So you can see there's a pronting here .

27
02:12.100 --> 02:17.640
If there is an error in the statements, cout

28
02:21.410 --> 02:43.840
enter two numbers, then cin a and B then, C assign a plus b, c out sum is and give some space and c.

29
02:44.520 --> 02:50.070
So this a program for picking two numbers from keyboard and adding them and displaying the result.

30
02:50.340 --> 02:53.370
So these two lines are for taking input from the user.

31
02:53.370 --> 02:58.710
These two lines are interactive as it is giving a message to the user informing him to give two numbers

32
02:59.400 --> 03:03.620
then adding two numbers and finding sum and displaying sum here.

33
03:04.380 --> 03:07.020
Let's run this.

34
03:07.740 --> 03:13.710
Now here is a message enter two numbers,  10 and 30.

35
03:13.740 --> 03:16.780
Now here the sum is 40.

36
03:17.430 --> 03:18.560
I should write endl.

37
03:18.570 --> 03:25.840
So that last message should come in the next line endl then let me answer.

38
03:30.150 --> 03:33.220
enter two numbers 10 and 30.

39
03:33.220 --> 03:37.300
So now this program ended with the exit code zero that is coming in the next line.

40
03:37.300 --> 03:39.240
So some is 40.

41
03:39.940 --> 03:41.320
That's it.

42
03:41.320 --> 03:47.200
So let me modify the same program and make it as a program for taking the user name and displaying

43
03:47.320 --> 03:49.010
a welcome message.

44
03:49.090 --> 03:57.520
So a string ever built in class available in C++ library that is a std iostream and we can access in

45
03:57.540 --> 03:58.430
the name space.

46
03:58.460 --> 04:03.790
The std here will give a message cout "may I know you name"

47
04:08.940 --> 04:12.020
then cin 'name'.

48
04:12.080 --> 04:14.230
So str is a variable name.

49
04:14.360 --> 04:16.130
Then cout.

50
04:17.740 --> 04:20.890
'Hello' a space here.

51
04:20.900 --> 04:31.100
So that space is there in between hello and name of a user. i will run the program.

52
04:31.410 --> 04:33.960
May I know your name.

53
04:33.980 --> 04:36.850
Let's say the name is John.

54
04:37.420 --> 04:41.140
So "hello John" its working.

55
04:42.140 --> 04:44.230
I run it once more.

56
04:44.390 --> 04:47.330
I'll give the name sai kumar.

57
04:47.380 --> 04:48.960
Let us see what happens.

58
04:51.300 --> 04:57.100
its giving just sai he's not giving the other name because the name is having two words here.

59
04:57.280 --> 04:59.290
It's really only one word.

60
04:59.650 --> 05:07.790
If you want to read all the words entered in a string then the right method is there is a function

61
05:07.810 --> 05:18.970
available called Get line, get line takes input stream that is cin and next is string variable, string

62
05:18.970 --> 05:20.290
object.

63
05:20.290 --> 05:25.670
Now let us read it using getline this is the method for an entire line from the keyboard.

64
05:29.340 --> 05:38.760
"May I know your name" so 'Sai Kumar' now i got a full name Sai Kumar  that's it.

65
05:39.100 --> 05:44.860
So this is a way you can access the strings whenever required is a biuld in object available in C++

66
05:45.210 --> 05:46.480
and is very useful object.
