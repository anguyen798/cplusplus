Here's an exercise program.

1
00:02.850 --> 00:06.720
So you have to write a program to calculate net salary.

2
00:06.940 --> 00:13.200
program should take following inputs that is basic salary and what is the percentage of alliances and

3
00:13.650 --> 00:17.950
percentage of deductions and the formula for salaries given below.

4
00:18.000 --> 00:24.300
So net salary is cal. by adding basic salary plus percentage of allowances of basic

5
00:24.300 --> 00:29.470
salary and subtracting percentage of deductions.

6
00:29.550 --> 00:33.970
So I'll show you the program how it should work and what should be the input and output.

7
00:34.050 --> 00:40.440
And you have to develop the same program. A pdf od program is also given in the resource if you want.

8
00:40.430 --> 00:44.130
You can download it but I suggest you write the program completely.

9
00:44.130 --> 00:47.970
If you face any difficulties then you can see that pdf.

10
00:48.600 --> 00:56.140
So here I run the program for calculating net salary of an employee, i will run program.

11
00:56.160 --> 01:02.670
See here just asking basic salary, let's say the  basic salary is a thousand bucks and what is the percentage

12
01:02.670 --> 01:03.760
of allowances.

13
01:03.760 --> 01:05.760
Suppose it is 20 percent.

14
01:06.030 --> 01:11.010
And what is the percentage of deduction that is 5 so 20 percent allowances.

15
01:11.010 --> 01:17.970
means it  will  12 hundred and five percent deduction means 50 subtracted from 1200 and that is

16
01:17.970 --> 01:19.760
1150 yes.

17
01:19.880 --> 01:25.460
so the ANSWER is 1150. so it should take these values and display this output.

18
01:26.310 --> 01:31.880
So program is also available under resources as a PDf and you can download that.
