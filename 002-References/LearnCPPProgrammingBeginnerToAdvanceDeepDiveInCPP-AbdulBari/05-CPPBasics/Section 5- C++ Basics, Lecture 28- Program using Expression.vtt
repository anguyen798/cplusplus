00:00.210 --> 00:05.040
we will write a program for finding the area of a triangle.

1
00:05.070 --> 00:08.220
Already we have seen the formula in the previous video.

2
00:08.290 --> 00:14.460
Now we will write a complete program so already in one of the video I have discuss what is the procedure

3
00:14.460 --> 00:16.200
and how to develop a program.

4
00:16.570 --> 00:23.610
So every basic program will have three parts or three elements first is input.

5
00:23.640 --> 00:27.220
It will take some input and then process the output.

6
00:27.270 --> 00:29.250
So these are the three steps that we will follow.

7
00:30.030 --> 00:35.400
So program should have these three things, some basic program, so whatever they input has or take it to take

8
00:35.430 --> 00:36.320
the values.

9
00:36.360 --> 00:38.250
Then it will process them and give output.

10
00:38.640 --> 00:41.270
So let us see for what we have to write on a program.

11
00:41.280 --> 00:43.140
We have to write a program for finding the area.

12
00:43.170 --> 00:49.590
So this is the formula base into height divided by two and that is area.

13
00:49.890 --> 00:57.430
So in this what is input base into height is input then more output Area is output.

14
00:57.510 --> 01:03.810
So this is output and these two are input of a program.

15
01:04.010 --> 01:04.880
Great.

16
01:05.100 --> 01:09.840
So now program should take two inputs and then give the output.

17
01:10.620 --> 01:16.160
So for this first of all every drop flow chart first thing is starting off the flow chart.

18
01:16.380 --> 01:18.650
So this is start now.

19
01:18.660 --> 01:21.810
Next we should take input.

20
01:21.830 --> 01:26.510
See imagine I am a program and you are using the program.

21
01:26.520 --> 01:27.750
So you are a user.

22
01:27.900 --> 01:34.050
So I have to find out the area of the triangle, then what I should know I should know what is base and

23
01:34.050 --> 01:37.440
height then I should ask you tell me what is base and height.

24
01:37.440 --> 01:39.320
So I should take input from you.

25
01:39.330 --> 01:41.000
So the first thing is input.

26
01:41.010 --> 01:42.330
So first of all I should ask.

27
01:42.330 --> 01:47.970
Please enter base and height so that can be done by  using a parallelogram.

28
01:48.060 --> 01:49.780
So input and output box.

29
01:49.800 --> 01:52.820
So here print I will write the message.

30
01:53.160 --> 01:58.630
Enter base and height enter base and height.

31
01:58.720 --> 01:59.480
this is the message.

32
01:59.520 --> 02:03.610
So it is just like I'm asking you to please give me base and height.

33
02:03.630 --> 02:08.360
Then you give me I will take them in variables so that is b and h.

34
02:08.490 --> 02:10.040
So two values whatever you give.

35
02:10.110 --> 02:11.740
I will read them.

36
02:11.850 --> 02:15.390
So this is input, input is over next process.

37
02:15.510 --> 02:18.090
So what is the process, formula.

38
02:18.210 --> 02:20.530
What is the formula? area.

39
02:20.670 --> 02:28.120
I will call it as a is assignment base into height by doing this the formula.

40
02:28.440 --> 02:32.320
So even I can write them in brackets also.

41
02:32.510 --> 02:33.950
Now process is over.

42
02:34.020 --> 02:35.730
Now next is output.

43
02:35.910 --> 02:38.370
So I have to give you the result.

44
02:38.610 --> 02:43.650
So I should tell you that area is so and so the next is again output.

45
02:43.860 --> 02:46.440
So for that paralellogram or  output box.

46
02:46.440 --> 02:50.610
So here I should say print area is .

47
02:50.880 --> 02:52.530
So this is the message I'm giving you.

48
02:52.560 --> 02:54.320
So this is area is.

49
02:54.330 --> 02:56.430
So the messages are written in quotes.

50
02:56.490 --> 02:58.590
Then next is a.

51
02:58.680 --> 03:04.750
I have the result in a so that's all the output end of the flow chart.

52
03:04.770 --> 03:05.480
So this is end.

53
03:05.520 --> 03:09.440
And the next thing I will write down the algorithm for this one.

54
03:09.510 --> 03:14.850
So the algorithm will contain the same thing just I have to group all of them together here and I was

55
03:14.850 --> 03:15.690
like an algorithm.

56
03:15.700 --> 03:23.930
And after that we will write a program. algorithm area.

57
03:24.320 --> 03:30.710
Now inside this let us begin not the same scripts first of all I should give a message to you I should

58
03:30.710 --> 03:41.150
tell you that enter base and height then I should read the values that you

59
03:41.150 --> 03:43.130
are giving me in b and h.

60
03:43.130 --> 03:51.590
These are variables then I should calculate area a assign  B into h by 2 now.

61
03:51.650 --> 03:53.370
Then I should print the result.

62
03:53.580 --> 03:59.590
Print area is so just it just print right.

63
03:59.690 --> 04:08.350
So print this one then end of this. thats it.  see whatever the contents are there in flow chart and then

64
04:08.350 --> 04:13.800
algorithm looks similar because this is just formula based  program or so very simple program.

65
04:13.920 --> 04:16.520
Write some extra things to write the algorithm.

66
04:16.640 --> 04:18.670
Right now it looks the same now.

67
04:18.740 --> 04:27.010
Next I have to write on a c++ program for this one. so first thing is hash include i should include a

68
04:27.020 --> 04:37.670
header file that is iostream. then using namespace std. 

69
04:37.670 --> 04:38.960
I have to write down.

70
04:39.440 --> 04:43.090
Then the next thing is int main function.

71
04:44.560 --> 04:48.310
Now let us convert this algorithm to a program.

72
04:48.490 --> 04:52.030
So inside the algorithm very first thing is enter base and height.

73
04:52.100 --> 04:53.230
So it is print.

74
04:53.270 --> 04:54.650
So how to write print.

75
04:54.680 --> 05:02.510
We use cout so already i have used namespace so I can directly saycout enter base and height

76
05:03.200 --> 05:05.940
and base and height.

77
05:06.860 --> 05:09.230
So this will give a message on the screen right.

78
05:09.260 --> 05:12.720
And on base and height this will appear on the screen.

79
05:12.730 --> 05:14.440
Then we need b and h.

80
05:14.450 --> 05:22.670
So for reading cin is there, so I should write cin that is extraction operator b done for another

81
05:22.670 --> 05:23.520
variable again.

82
05:23.520 --> 05:23.820
again.

83
05:23.810 --> 05:24.380
write the operator

84
05:24.410 --> 05:25.270
So we cannot write

85
05:25.270 --> 05:25.640
Comma.

86
05:25.670 --> 05:27.230
Don't get confused here.

87
05:27.230 --> 05:31.560
As many variables you are rereading you should write all of them with extraction operator.

88
05:32.420 --> 05:35.230
Now next important thing this b and h.

89
05:35.240 --> 05:37.380
What they are? variables.

90
05:37.490 --> 05:41.050
So in C++ program you must declare the variable first.

91
05:41.080 --> 05:46.640
So can that is go back on the top and declare the variable which type of league tables we want here.

92
05:46.670 --> 05:48.680
see this result should be in float.

93
05:48.680 --> 05:50.470
So let us make everything as float.

94
05:50.780 --> 05:56.060
So I will declare them as float base height and area.

95
05:56.480 --> 05:59.650
So I have three variables all of them are of type float.

96
05:59.660 --> 06:04.590
The next step in the algorithm we have finished with this is step and this is step the next is process.

97
06:04.610 --> 06:06.330
So find out the area.

98
06:06.410 --> 06:12.360
So a assign B in to h divided by two.

99
06:12.470 --> 06:18.530
And this I can put it in bracket that the next step is print the result than end.

100
06:18.800 --> 06:27.890
So here I will write on area is so c out first of all a message that this area is right.

101
06:27.960 --> 06:34.010
There's a message then display a variable so this is a variable see the message should be double quotes

102
06:34.140 --> 06:36.070
variable should not be in double quotes.

103
06:36.680 --> 06:38.780
Then end of the program.

104
06:39.170 --> 06:40.850
So this is the C++ program.

105
06:40.850 --> 06:47.440
So first we have written the flowchart and convert it to an algorithm that is having input process output

106
06:47.450 --> 06:52.450
so this also having input and then process and output so these lines are input.

107
06:52.730 --> 07:00.060
And this is for process and these lines for output so I'll give the demonstration of this program in

108
07:00.060 --> 07:00.960
the next video.

109
07:01.080 --> 07:06.410
But before that you have a coding exercise so in that coding exercise you have to write down the formula

110
07:06.410 --> 07:07.770
for this one.

111
07:07.770 --> 07:09.900
So some code is already done there.

112
07:09.900 --> 07:14.390
So just you have to write on the formula properly for finding the area of a triangle.

113
07:15.150 --> 07:20.880
So read the description in coding exercise and also read the comments properly and complete the codings

114
07:20.880 --> 07:21.330
exercise.

115
07:21.330 --> 07:27.000
Then after that you will find a demonstration video that after watching it you can do it on your own

116
07:27.000 --> 07:27.590
machine.

117
07:27.630 --> 07:28.850
So that's all in this video.

118
07:28.860 --> 07:34.260
You will learn more formulas in the coming videos, we will write more programs using just formulas and

119
07:34.320 --> 07:35.120
expressions.
