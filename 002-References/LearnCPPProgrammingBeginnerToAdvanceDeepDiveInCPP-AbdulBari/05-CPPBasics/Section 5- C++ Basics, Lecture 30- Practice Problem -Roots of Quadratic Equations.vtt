00:00.500 --> 00:05.360
in this video we will write a program for finding the roots of a quadratic equation.

1
00:06.180 --> 00:10.110
So first of all what is quadratic equation, a equation of this form.

2
00:10.110 --> 00:15.210
That is a polynomial of this form,  X square, X and X poverty zero.

3
00:15.210 --> 00:17.520
This is x power 2, x power 1,  power 0.

4
00:17.520 --> 00:18.600
There is nothing yet.

5
00:18.660 --> 00:20.640
It means one is there that is x power 0.

6
00:20.910 --> 00:22.510
So the higest degree is a 2.

7
00:22.590 --> 00:29.680
So a polynomial of degree 2 is a quadratic expression and when it is equal to something that is 0 that

8
00:29.680 --> 00:31.710
it is quadratic equation.

9
00:32.100 --> 00:37.680
Then the coefficients of the highest degree term and the next degree term and the next degree term in the

10
00:37.680 --> 00:38.820
decreasing order.

11
00:38.820 --> 00:45.180
So these are the variables that are used here to find out the roots means what are the possible values

12
00:45.180 --> 00:45.870
of x.

13
00:45.930 --> 00:50.400
So we get the possible values of X if we know ABC.

14
00:50.400 --> 00:53.340
So roots can be known by using this formula.

15
00:53.370 --> 00:58.640
So actually we will know for what values values of x this equation will be equal to zero.

16
00:58.650 --> 01:02.990
That's it. so that are roots so we'll know the values of x.

17
01:03.140 --> 01:09.290
Now for this we will write a program. a program will take the input and find out the roots and give the

18
01:09.340 --> 01:09.840
output.

19
01:10.020 --> 01:12.290
So we will follow those steps.

20
01:12.660 --> 01:22.670
So let us see what is input. input is A B and C these three variables are input and root.

21
01:22.670 --> 01:24.930
The result is the output.

22
01:24.930 --> 01:27.000
So far this let us first draw a flowchart.

23
01:27.420 --> 01:31.170
So start a flow chart.

24
01:31.180 --> 01:32.430
What is the input.

25
01:32.430 --> 01:34.680
We should know the coefficients ABC.

26
01:34.710 --> 01:35.550
Three things.

27
01:35.550 --> 01:45.280
So inside this input output box and give a message and the coefficients enter coefficients or instead

28
01:45.290 --> 01:46.110
of coefficients.

29
01:46.110 --> 01:51.130
I will say enter a b and c these three values.

30
01:51.250 --> 01:56.140
Now I read ABC so I should take the values.

31
01:56.210 --> 02:02.410
You imagine I am a program I have to calculate the roots so then I should take ABC values from you right.

32
02:02.620 --> 02:06.580
this is the coefficients, next is process so in the process.

33
02:06.600 --> 02:12.900
Actually we get two roots because one is with the plus and one was minus so r1 is  the first root

34
02:13.140 --> 02:21.630
and that is minus B plus and sqrt of this formula B square minus 4ac.

35
02:21.630 --> 02:28.140
So this b into b  minus 4 into a into c.

36
02:28.230 --> 02:37.980
I need more space, than this whole thing should be divided by two into a, yes this is the first one and

37
02:37.980 --> 02:46.950
same way root2 also everything is same minus B, instead of this plus this is minus, sqrt  of b into

38
02:46.950 --> 03:00.540
B minus 4 ininto a into C then by 2 into a.  I got two routes now I have to give the output that

39
03:00.540 --> 03:12.150
is the result so give a message that routes are so print the message roots are then first

40
03:12.150 --> 03:22.870
one is r1 and the second one is r2, r1 and R2. next  the end of a flowchart now this is similar

41
03:22.870 --> 03:26.140
to the one we have seen in the previous videos also.

42
03:26.140 --> 03:27.750
So you can write on the algorithm.

43
03:27.900 --> 03:33.880
Now I will write on a C++ program for this fun so let us convert this flowchart into C++ program for

44
03:33.880 --> 03:35.140
the very first thing you know well.

45
03:35.250 --> 03:39.660
That is hash include iostream right.

46
03:39.700 --> 03:44.140
So this is the first thing then we have to say.

47
03:44.140 --> 03:48.780
Using namespace so say using namespace right.

48
03:48.970 --> 03:55.960
Using namespace std then main function this the entry point for program.

49
03:55.960 --> 03:59.360
So instead the main function what is the first thing I should do.

50
03:59.420 --> 04:02.050
take input read ABC.

51
04:02.320 --> 04:09.720
So I should be giving a message cout enter a b c right.

52
04:09.790 --> 04:16.910
So the one who is using this program should know that ABC are the coefficients of quadratic equations.

53
04:16.930 --> 04:19.330
Now I will be reading this ABC.

54
04:19.330 --> 04:24.640
So when I am reading ABC I realize that these are the variables that I must declare.

55
04:24.760 --> 04:25.020
Yes.

56
04:25.030 --> 04:25.980
So what are the variables.

57
04:25.990 --> 04:29.370
I need a b c r1, r2.

58
04:29.380 --> 04:30.440
These are the variables I need.

59
04:30.780 --> 04:32.890
So declare them all of them here on the top.

60
04:32.890 --> 04:37.350
So I will declare all of them as float because this float is involved here.

61
04:37.360 --> 04:39.340
So let us make all of them as float.

62
04:39.490 --> 04:42.620
That is a b c r1 r2.

63
04:42.650 --> 04:51.970
all the variables I have declared then the first one r1 assign with minus B plus same formula.

64
04:52.030 --> 04:58.410
So I need not write down that same thing as it is I have written perfectly as required in C++ program.

65
04:58.560 --> 05:02.350
write on this one then r2 that is the same formula.

66
05:02.530 --> 05:05.800
just install plus use minus.

67
05:05.800 --> 05:07.000
Then after that print.

68
05:07.330 --> 05:10.120
So the result C out now.

69
05:10.160 --> 05:11.850
Watch this carefully.

70
05:11.860 --> 05:15.930
I will say roots are then,.

71
05:16.480 --> 05:23.010
After this first root then next  second root.

72
05:23.400 --> 05:28.170
But there should be space in between two values because the first time we are displaying two values

73
05:28.200 --> 05:28.600
now.

74
05:28.740 --> 05:30.360
So there should be space in between them.

75
05:30.360 --> 05:33.180
Suppose one value is one another is one five.

76
05:33.300 --> 05:35.210
There should be a space in between them.

77
05:35.340 --> 05:38.390
So roots are then for the space.

78
05:38.430 --> 05:47.950
Just give quotes with a blank space then gives r2 that's it. and the last thing is return 0.

79
05:48.150 --> 05:51.230
So this is what because we have written int here.

80
05:51.730 --> 05:55.110
So return 0 is like a formality.

81
05:55.110 --> 06:00.120
Later we will learn what does it really mean by return0 in the later videos.

82
06:00.120 --> 06:00.840
So that's all.

83
06:01.090 --> 06:07.020
this is a C++ program so there is a coding  exercise available so you have to write on this complete formula

84
06:07.020 --> 06:12.270
there so read the description and whatever is asked in that coding exercise you'll complete that.

85
06:12.390 --> 06:14.860
Then after that there is a demo video on this one.

86
06:15.000 --> 06:21.360
So the coding part so you have to practice that on your own machine and also there are a few more coding

87
06:21.360 --> 06:23.280
exercises for the other formulas.

88
06:23.280 --> 06:28.380
We have seen in the beginning when we were talking of what it's like for finding the speed and finding

89
06:28.380 --> 06:33.770
the perimeter of a rectangle like that there are some more coding exercises.

90
06:33.780 --> 06:37.440
So read the description and you can do that right.

91
06:37.470 --> 06:42.870
So that's all about the expression and all then we will move on to the next topic.

92
06:43.530 --> 06:48.540
So that's all level the expressions and all we have seen different expressions and written the programs.

93
06:48.590 --> 06:51.660
Now really move to a little advance topic in the next video.
