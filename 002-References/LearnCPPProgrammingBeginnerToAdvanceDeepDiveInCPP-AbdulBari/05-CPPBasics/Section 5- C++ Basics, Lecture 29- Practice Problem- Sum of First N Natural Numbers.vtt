00:00.920 --> 00:06.450
In this video let us write a program for finding the sum of first natural numbers.

1
00:06.450 --> 00:09.980
Already we have seen the formula in the video called expression.

2
00:09.980 --> 00:15.470
So let us write a complete program. let us  see what does it mean by sum of first n natural number, see

3
00:15.770 --> 00:21.380
natural numbers starts from one onwards so one plus two plus three plus so on upto some number if you

4
00:21.380 --> 00:26.300
want to find a sum of all these numbers that the formula is there that is n into n plus one by two.

5
00:27.050 --> 00:34.280
So for example if I want to find out one plus two plus three plus four plus five up to five I want to

6
00:34.280 --> 00:39.170
find out how much it is, three plus three six 10 then 15.

7
00:39.470 --> 00:42.820
So this is coming up to 15 now sum is 15.

8
00:42.860 --> 00:47.960
So if I use that formula what it will be like up to five and finding out.

9
00:47.990 --> 00:49.910
So this is a five into(*).

10
00:50.240 --> 00:52.700
This is five plus one six by two.

11
00:53.030 --> 00:55.910
So how is this a 6 1 6 threes.

12
00:55.970 --> 00:57.750
So 5 3 15.

13
00:57.770 --> 00:59.170
So this also 15.

14
00:59.210 --> 01:00.580
So yes this is the formula.

15
01:01.940 --> 01:07.040
So formula for finding the sum all first n natural number, up to what number you find out.

16
01:07.610 --> 01:10.920
So this is a well-known formula but I already have explained it now.

17
01:11.050 --> 01:13.980
Now next we want to write a program for program.

18
01:13.980 --> 01:17.890
Let us first of all write down a flowchart. so I will prepare a flow chart.

19
01:17.900 --> 01:23.120
So for the flow chart we should follow these steps for writing the program, as well as for flow chart, input,

20
01:23.420 --> 01:27.650
process, output so the basic programs will have these things.

21
01:27.650 --> 01:29.310
So what is input for this program.

22
01:29.660 --> 01:31.260
Let us see in the formula.

23
01:31.650 --> 01:32.970
n is input.

24
01:33.050 --> 01:37.060
Yes this is input then what is output sum is output.

25
01:37.190 --> 01:37.670
Yes.

26
01:37.760 --> 01:38.920
this is the output

27
01:38.930 --> 01:41.270
And that is the formula for processing.

28
01:41.270 --> 01:42.190
Use the formula.

29
01:42.710 --> 01:45.360
So let us draw the flow chart.

30
01:45.500 --> 01:48.890
Let us start first start.

31
01:50.100 --> 01:57.080
First step I should take the input so I should have input box and here I will say print  enter n

32
01:57.090 --> 02:02.580
I should know the value of n. see the input this n here.

33
02:02.600 --> 02:11.420
So I should know the value n so enter n then read a value n in a variable, then next step is a

34
02:11.420 --> 02:14.050
process, so second step is process.

35
02:14.080 --> 02:15.360
So this input is over.

36
02:15.620 --> 02:23.650
Next is process, so what's the the processing, calculating sum, so how to cal. sum, sum assigned with n into n

37
02:23.670 --> 02:26.510
plus 1 by 2.

38
02:26.750 --> 02:30.120
This is processing the next step is output.

39
02:30.170 --> 02:34.950
So we have the result. where is result? in variable sum so print that one.

40
02:34.970 --> 02:38.120
Then again the input output box.

41
02:38.120 --> 02:46.370
So I will write on this and I will give a message that print 'sum is' then after this I will write down

42
02:46.370 --> 02:49.820
variable name. so there's a message in double quotes.

43
02:50.060 --> 02:55.610
Then after this end of flow chart so stop flow chart.

44
02:56.270 --> 03:01.650
So there is a flow chart for finding the sum of first n natural number using this formula.

45
03:02.090 --> 03:05.260
Now next thing in the previous video I have written algorithm.

46
03:05.320 --> 03:06.510
I will not write it.

47
03:06.590 --> 03:11.880
You know how to write it just you have to take these steps and write them and begin and end block.

48
03:12.030 --> 03:18.830
For now I will write on a C++ program directly so I remove this and I write down a C++ program looking

49
03:18.830 --> 03:28.150
at the flowchart. starting of a program First of all say hash include iostream we have to include this header file

50
03:29.080 --> 03:36.490
them using namespace using namespace std that is standard.

51
03:36.560 --> 03:41.700
In short it is a std then int main function.

52
03:41.850 --> 03:44.920
Now inside this false thing what I should do.

53
03:45.110 --> 03:47.730
Enter and print.

54
03:47.870 --> 03:53.210
So print means output on the screen so display C out so first thing.

55
03:53.240 --> 04:02.310
cout enter n, next I should read the value.

56
04:02.310 --> 04:10.640
So for reading the value it is cin so say Cin abstraction operator n what is n.

57
04:10.640 --> 04:12.160
n that is a variable.

58
04:12.300 --> 04:13.930
So I should declare the variable first.

59
04:14.120 --> 04:14.780
Yes.

60
04:14.840 --> 04:17.900
So if you read this flowchart what are the variables are required.

61
04:18.190 --> 04:24.500
n and also has sum, so which type is this, see it should be int type because you are finding the sum

62
04:24.510 --> 04:26.450
of first n natural numbers that are integers.

63
04:26.600 --> 04:29.950
So n as well as sum.

64
04:30.740 --> 04:34.210
Don't worry about the division because you will not get decimal result there.

65
04:34.250 --> 04:42.020
So you will get integer result only. so this is over the next step is finding formula that is sum, sum assign

66
04:43.480 --> 04:51.130
n into n plus one by two then after that print the result.

67
04:51.260 --> 04:59.490
So sum, this is the step I'm writing  that is output sum is this is the message it is closed.

68
04:59.510 --> 05:06.740
Then again insertion operator write down the variable name that is sum. this sum is the variable name

69
05:06.750 --> 05:08.820
is a part of a message right.

70
05:09.020 --> 05:15.110
So I can even write a complete message sum of first n natural numbers is so and so, then after

71
05:15.110 --> 05:22.240
that, as we wrote int here so we can write a return 0 here and that's all.

72
05:23.210 --> 05:29.230
So that's all this is the program so there is coding exercise available for this one so which asks you

73
05:29.230 --> 05:34.690
to write on the formula so read the coding exercise and read the comments properly and then complete

74
05:34.690 --> 05:35.600
the coding exercise.

75
05:35.600 --> 05:41.450
Then after that we say that we have a video for demonstration of this one right so after watching you

76
05:41.450 --> 05:44.020
practice on your own machine.

77
05:44.020 --> 05:46.420
If you have any questions if you get any errors.

78
05:46.420 --> 05:52.840
Just give yours screen shot to me in question answer section then I will give you a replay, if you face

79
05:52.870 --> 05:56.280
any problem so that's all in this video.

80
05:56.320 --> 05:58.570
Now next the videos we will see more formulas.
