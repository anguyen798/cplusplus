00:00.770 --> 00:06.790
In the previous section we have already learned how to download and install the compiler and the ide

1
00:06.810 --> 00:09.900
required for developing c++ program.

2
00:09.900 --> 00:14.970
Hope you're ready with the setup if you're not ready i suggest you go back to the previous section

3
00:15.450 --> 00:20.330
and watch the videos and get the environment ready on your P.C..

4
00:21.120 --> 00:28.070
in this video I'm going to show you the skeleton or the basic programs of C++ in the following video

5
00:28.070 --> 00:29.270
you will find a demo.

6
00:29.280 --> 00:32.790
How to start a new project and how to develop the first program.

7
00:33.690 --> 00:39.090
So here first of all let us start with the skeleton of a C++ program.

8
00:39.110 --> 00:42.850
See this is a skeleton already i have kept it ready here.

9
00:42.990 --> 00:44.370
You have to start a new project.

10
00:44.370 --> 00:48.100
Let us say the project name is first and the program.

11
00:48.100 --> 00:49.630
First.cpp 

12
00:49.740 --> 00:54.280
So you have to start this one the inside that this is what you have to get done.

13
00:54.360 --> 00:57.980
So every c++ program basically looks like this.

14
00:58.020 --> 01:00.520
So let us understand what are these elements.

15
01:00.570 --> 01:02.200
So I'll start from this point.

16
01:02.220 --> 01:05.640
See this is the starting point of the C++ program.

17
01:05.640 --> 01:07.670
Main function.

18
01:07.820 --> 01:10.970
This is main and their own brackets are there for the function.

19
01:10.970 --> 01:15.090
The main function is the starting point of C++ program.

20
01:15.330 --> 01:16.800
Then what does this int.

21
01:16.950 --> 01:20.270
This is called as a return type of a function.

22
01:20.330 --> 01:25.830
We will be learning about the return types and on afterwards but right now as a formality you have to

23
01:25.830 --> 01:33.720
write it always and when you have written int their at this place then you have to write return zero at

24
01:33.720 --> 01:35.560
the end of the main function.

25
01:35.910 --> 01:42.740
And this is the body of a main function back that is the opening flower bracket and closing flower bracket. Now

26
01:42.850 --> 01:44.270
what all you have to write on.

27
01:44.280 --> 01:49.830
You have to write it here inside the body of main function.

28
01:49.830 --> 01:52.140
Then what does it mean by this #include.

29
01:52.470 --> 01:53.740
I'll explain it.

30
01:53.850 --> 01:58.720
So first of all I will write something here inside the main function and show you.

31
01:58.830 --> 02:05.460
So here as a first program I want to give a welcome message so I will write Hello world.

32
02:05.700 --> 02:09.960
So I want this program to print on the screen hello world.

33
02:09.990 --> 02:11.580
when I run the program.

34
02:12.150 --> 02:14.920
So how to print something on the screen. so for

35
02:14.910 --> 02:19.920
printing anything on the monitor that is on the screen from your c++ program.

36
02:19.980 --> 02:31.600
There is a built in object available in C++ that is C out C means console, out that is console out so

37
02:31.600 --> 02:34.510
monitor is treated as a console.

38
02:34.510 --> 02:41.860
That is output console then there is something that is keyboard that is useful for taking input right.

39
02:42.100 --> 02:44.930
So does this input console.

40
02:45.060 --> 02:55.780
So it means for that there is C in Yes c out for monitor console out, C in that console in for keyboard

41
02:55.820 --> 02:57.790
that is taking any input from the keyboard.

42
02:58.570 --> 03:01.810
So let us use the c out and print something on the monitor.

43
03:02.050 --> 03:04.330
So as I said we will be printing Hello.

44
03:04.350 --> 03:04.970
World.

45
03:05.050 --> 03:07.870
So we have to use this two angular brackets.

46
03:07.870 --> 03:13.470
This is called as insertion operator insertion operator.

47
03:13.720 --> 03:17.530
We have to use this one for printing anything.

48
03:17.530 --> 03:21.030
Then here inside the double quotes I will say hello

49
03:21.060 --> 03:21.720
World.

50
03:22.240 --> 03:24.700
So what ever the messages that you have to print.

51
03:24.700 --> 03:26.740
You have to give it in double quotes.

52
03:27.100 --> 03:30.040
So this is a string or a message.

53
03:30.040 --> 03:31.780
It's a string or a message.

54
03:31.810 --> 03:33.610
This is given to C out.

55
03:33.730 --> 03:35.490
So it will be printed on the monitor.

56
03:35.740 --> 03:37.160
So when you run the program.

57
03:37.210 --> 03:39.710
Hello world will appear here .

58
03:39.870 --> 03:47.750
hello world will appear here, so Cout is a object used for printing anything on the monitor.

59
03:48.590 --> 03:54.790
And if you see this double less than symbol, two less than symbols both are on the keyboard you will find

60
03:54.790 --> 03:56.600
less than symbol for two times.

61
03:56.740 --> 04:01.000
So that is acting as a insertion operator if you'll feel it.

62
04:01.180 --> 04:04.930
It looks like as if inserting this one in Cout.

63
04:05.090 --> 04:08.920
So once I inserted it would appear on a monitor.

64
04:09.190 --> 04:11.400
It gives the feeling that you are inserting something.

65
04:11.410 --> 04:13.740
So that's why it is called as insertion object.

66
04:14.440 --> 04:21.290
So this how we can print now next thing where the cout came from ?

67
04:21.340 --> 04:24.520
We know that for every C++ program we should write down

68
04:24.520 --> 04:29.130
Int, main, flower bracket, close and return then whatever we are writing here.

69
04:29.180 --> 04:34.180
where this C out came from? the C out object as well as C in object.

70
04:34.180 --> 04:42.220
These are present inside this iostream header file so actually this is a library.

71
04:42.220 --> 04:49.450
Library will contain the collection off of build in objects or functions that a programmer can use and

72
04:49.570 --> 04:51.250
easily write the program.

73
04:51.250 --> 04:54.090
This is provided by C++ compiler.

74
04:54.120 --> 04:56.930
When we install the compiler you will get the libraries.

75
04:57.010 --> 05:02.410
So there are many libraries we will learn about them slowly so whatever your requirement is depending

76
05:02.410 --> 05:07.270
on that you can include the library in your program so everything from the library will be attached

77
05:07.270 --> 05:09.210
to your program and you can use it.

78
05:10.090 --> 05:12.330
So cout is present in this library.

79
05:12.340 --> 05:20.080
That is iostream library for including that one we include bytes name or bytes header file so in

80
05:20.120 --> 05:24.830
some compilers even you have to write down iostream.h right.

81
05:25.090 --> 05:33.510
If this doesn't work in your compiler then you write iostream.h or else  just iostream now.

82
05:33.540 --> 05:36.930
I will remove these things and I'll explain a few more things about this one.

83
05:38.750 --> 05:40.640
The cout as it is present there.

84
05:40.650 --> 05:42.000
We cannot use it directly.

85
05:42.000 --> 05:48.720
We have to write down namespace so I have to write a std double column.

86
05:48.720 --> 05:50.420
The symbol you will find on the keyboard.

87
05:50.430 --> 05:54.210
You hit it for two times so this is Scope resolution.

88
05:54.210 --> 05:55.070
Colon and colon.

89
05:55.080 --> 05:56.270
That is double colon.

90
05:56.280 --> 06:04.050
This is called us scope resolution so the correct method is right down std scope resolution and cout and

91
06:04.050 --> 06:04.860
whatever you want.

92
06:04.890 --> 06:08.650
If this is how we use that cout object.

93
06:08.760 --> 06:10.400
Now this is a perfect program.

94
06:10.740 --> 06:13.990
If you run it you will get hello world on the screen.

95
06:14.910 --> 06:20.100
Now one more thing if you're writing a very lengthy program or bigger program and you have to use 

96
06:20.100 --> 06:26.280
cout many times then instead of writing it like this there is another way of doing this using that

97
06:26.450 --> 06:36.150
C out as well as cin object. the other method is, here we can write using namespace, using namespace

98
06:37.020 --> 06:39.370
and this namespace std.

99
06:40.050 --> 06:45.240
So when we say that we are using this namespace we don't have to see this one.

100
06:45.240 --> 06:51.240
We can directly write cout it  means that we are using that namespace means whatever it is there inside

101
06:51.240 --> 06:52.980
that namespace we are using it.

102
06:53.170 --> 06:54.950
And what does it mean by namespace.

103
06:55.000 --> 07:01.140
See all the build in things available in this header that is library are grouped under one name

104
07:01.260 --> 07:09.040
that is STD so for using that we have to say using namespace name. now more about namespace.

105
07:09.040 --> 07:11.980
We will learn in this course we will find our topic.

106
07:11.980 --> 07:17.590
There is a video available is a separate topic so everything about namespaces are discussed at their

107
07:18.960 --> 07:19.900
writing.

108
07:19.900 --> 07:26.340
STD here is better than saying that we are using namespace because we are not using everything from

109
07:26.340 --> 07:27.060
the namespace.

110
07:27.060 --> 07:28.220
We want just Cout.

111
07:28.470 --> 07:31.390
So writing a std colon and cout is better.

112
07:31.620 --> 07:39.030
But it is easy for the beginners to just write cout so I may be using cout many times but on the top

113
07:39.030 --> 07:45.420
I will writing namespace and here I will write cout just cout so that's all it is the first

114
07:45.420 --> 07:46.130
program.

115
07:46.170 --> 07:51.330
Let us quickly look at the things that we have leaned see we have learned that every C program will have

116
07:51.330 --> 07:55.170
a main function main function should write integer and as it is done.

117
07:55.170 --> 07:59.210
So here we should write return zero then inside the flower backets.

118
07:59.220 --> 08:01.780
That is body whatever you want you can write on here.

119
08:02.040 --> 08:07.290
So in my program I am just displaying it. so for that COUT is an object that is already available.

120
08:07.300 --> 08:10.200
I'm using it for printing something on the screen.

121
08:10.380 --> 08:15.920
The cout is present in the header file so I should include the header file and this header file

122
08:15.920 --> 08:21.210
is having this namespace so I should also use that namespace just including the header file is not

123
08:21.210 --> 08:21.650
sufficient.

124
08:21.660 --> 08:24.120
You have to use that namespace inside that one.

125
08:24.480 --> 08:29.230
If you don't want to use it then you can write on STD scope resolution here.

126
08:29.330 --> 08:33.630
Then the next you I will show you some simple programs of C++.
