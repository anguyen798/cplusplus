Here is an exercise program you have to write a program to calculate area of a circle and for that you

1
00:08.850 --> 00:16.200
have to take input as a radius and using the formula for area of a circle calculate area and display

2
00:16.290 --> 00:17.210
area.

3
00:17.650 --> 00:23.580
Here is the program I've run the program and show you how the program should work and what should be

4
00:23.580 --> 00:25.370
the input output.

5
00:25.380 --> 00:27.320
Let us look at the program.

6
00:27.440 --> 00:30.460
Here is the program for finding the area of a circle.

7
00:30.480 --> 00:35.870
I will run the program and show you. see he asking for the radius of a circle.

8
00:35.910 --> 00:38.010
I'll give the radius as a 10.

9
00:38.040 --> 00:43.230
It should display the area of a circle and some very simple program you can easily like this one.

10
00:43.230 --> 00:47.160
So here is the code and even the code is available as PDF.
