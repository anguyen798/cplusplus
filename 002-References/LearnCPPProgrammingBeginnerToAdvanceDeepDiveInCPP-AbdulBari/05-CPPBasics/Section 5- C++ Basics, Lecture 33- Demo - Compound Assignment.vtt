Let us look at compound statements these are commonly used statements in programming.

1
00:04.860 --> 00:11.490
Like if I have a variable sum which is having value ten then also I have one variable x that is having

2
00:11.490 --> 00:12.410
value 5.

3
00:12.570 --> 00:19.930
So usually we say what? sum Plus assign X so the value of x and sum are added. then where the results

4
00:19.930 --> 00:20.710
should be stored?

5
00:20.730 --> 00:23.410
I'm storing it in sum again.

6
00:24.060 --> 00:31.240
So I can say that the value of sum is updated by adding value of x.

7
00:31.350 --> 00:36.310
So the result is back in X. let us display this and see what the result

8
00:36.420 --> 00:43.600
Will be shown. see this is 15,  ten plus 5 is 15.

9
00:43.620 --> 00:50.360
So instead of writing this statement like this writing  sum on the side we can also say sum Plus assign x.

10
00:50.400 --> 00:55.280
So this is a compound statement for addition and the result will be same

11
00:59.730 --> 01:01.740
it is 15.

12
01:01.740 --> 01:05.100
So this is a very handy statement and it is more readable.

13
01:05.100 --> 01:10.920
Instead of writing sum on both the sides, if you write compound statement if you use then it's very

14
01:10.980 --> 01:15.060
easy to read even I use multiplication here.

15
01:15.540 --> 01:20.640
So this will multiply X with the sum and the result is stored in sum again.

16
01:20.640 --> 01:26.790
So if I am displaying it then the result would be 50.

17
01:27.100 --> 01:30.480
And one more statement I'll show you more commonly used.

18
01:30.480 --> 01:34.390
That is if I have a variable X whose value is 10.

19
01:34.410 --> 01:37.170
Then I can say X assign X plus 1.

20
01:37.170 --> 01:40.230
So this will increase the value of X by 1.

21
01:40.620 --> 01:49.240
And if I print this one X, lets print  the value of x, x should change by 1 incremented by 1.

22
01:49.770 --> 01:52.310
Yes it became 11.

23
01:52.860 --> 01:58.340
Even we can use minus.

24
01:58.460 --> 02:00.350
This is decrement by 1, 9

25
02:00.350 --> 02:03.890
We are getting the result. now instead of writing like this.

26
02:03.890 --> 02:07.110
We can also say X plus assign 1.

27
02:07.130 --> 02:08.720
So one will be added to x

28
02:13.030 --> 02:14.490
and that's it.

29
02:14.860 --> 02:16.270
This is 11.

30
02:16.480 --> 02:19.180
So this is all you can you make use of compound statements.

31
02:19.180 --> 02:22.630
So we will write few programs where we'll be using compound statements.
