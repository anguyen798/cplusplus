Here is an exercise program for linear search, you are supposed to write this program using function.

1
00:06.120 --> 00:07.610
You should have the list of elements in

2
00:07.650 --> 00:13.050
an array,and array shoould be paased as a parameter to  a function for searching it  given

3
00:13.050 --> 00:13.830
key element.

4
00:13.830 --> 00:19.410
So you should now what should be the name of the function what should be the parametal list of a function

5
00:19.500 --> 00:21.290
write the logic for linear search.

6
00:21.380 --> 00:25.370
already  we have seen linear search logic.

7
00:25.430 --> 00:31.100
So here I will run the program and show you how the input and output of the program should be.

8
00:31.100 --> 00:35.010
And even PDF of a program is given as a resource.

9
00:35.060 --> 00:38.020
You can check if you need it.

10
00:38.160 --> 00:40.040
Here is a program for linear search.

11
00:40.070 --> 00:43.880
Already I have discussed and explain what is linear search how it works.

12
00:44.090 --> 00:49.300
But we have to write down the program using a function a function should take the array of elements as parameters 

13
00:49.350 --> 00:53.340
that is number of elements and the key to be searched.

14
00:53.660 --> 00:56.040
So you have to write down the same program using function.

15
00:56.030 --> 01:00.900
So more focus here is how to write a program using functions.

16
01:00.980 --> 01:03.480
I have given the name of a function as search.

17
01:03.560 --> 01:08.790
Let me run the program and show you, already I have given you have given the list of elements here.

18
01:08.900 --> 01:12.050
It will be searching within those given elements.

19
01:12.080 --> 01:14.830
Now here is asking for the element to be searched.

20
01:14.870 --> 01:20.600
I have an element 9, available in my array so element 9 has found at index 5.

21
01:20.640 --> 01:22.880
I wil run the program once again.

22
01:22.880 --> 01:26.410
I'll give the element as 12 now, 12 is  not there in my list.

23
01:26.600 --> 01:29.150
So now it is giving the index size minus 1.

24
01:29.150 --> 01:31.680
So that's what, if the elrment is not found on the list.

25
01:31.700 --> 01:33.370
It should give the index minus 1.

26
01:33.470 --> 01:37.830
If  it is found then it should return its index.

27
01:38.000 --> 01:39.930
So try this program by yourself.

28
01:39.950 --> 01:43.130
And if any difficulty you can check the program in PDF.
