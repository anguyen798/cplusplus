Let us look at what are the levels of scopes.

1
00:02.500 --> 00:03.240
C plus plus.

2
00:03.270 --> 00:09.870
Suppose I have three variables X that is global variable and there's a local to the main function.

3
00:09.980 --> 00:13.030
And this is local within this block.

4
00:13.050 --> 00:17.150
So C++ have block level scope now inside this block.

5
00:17.190 --> 00:25.950
If I print cout X then which value will be printed, so it will print the nearest value of x that is 30

6
00:26.580 --> 00:27.770
and outside the block.

7
00:27.810 --> 00:36.270
If I say cout X then which X will be printed it will printing the value that is in it's nearest

8
00:36.270 --> 00:37.000
scope.

9
00:37.050 --> 00:39.600
So this variable was inside this block.

10
00:39.610 --> 00:41.590
Now cout is outside the block.

11
00:41.790 --> 00:43.400
So when I look out.

12
00:43.440 --> 00:48.120
So it will find this variable x so it will display this value 20.

13
00:48.140 --> 00:55.170
So if I run this program I will get the value 30 and then 20 and inside the main function this X will

14
00:55.170 --> 00:57.010
never be accessible.

15
00:57.120 --> 01:01.230
That is ten, cannot be accessible inside main function.

16
01:01.230 --> 01:07.170
Whenever I say X this will be accessing this local variable X but if at all I want to access this global

17
01:07.170 --> 01:12.350
variable x then I should say cout scope resolution x.

18
01:12.420 --> 01:18.360
So this'll be accessing that Global X that you can see that the color of x has change to green.

19
01:18.360 --> 01:27.720
Now let us run this and see the values that I should get are first here 30 then 20 then here ten, yea

20
01:27.720 --> 01:32.460
here are 30 20 and 10, this is the values that I got from this one.

21
01:32.580 --> 01:34.880
So C++ have block levels scope.
