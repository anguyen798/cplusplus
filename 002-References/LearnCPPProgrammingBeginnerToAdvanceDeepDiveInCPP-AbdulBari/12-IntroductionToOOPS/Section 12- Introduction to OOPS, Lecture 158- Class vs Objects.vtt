00:00.150 --> 00:02.180
So let's talk about class.

1
00:02.190 --> 00:03.360
versus object.

2
00:03.360 --> 00:04.950
Why is an class? What is an object?

3
00:04.950 --> 00:08.520
Mostly people say that everything in the world is an object and there is a glass for it.

4
00:08.520 --> 00:11.000
So let us understand what us mean.

5
00:11.010 --> 00:12.600
See classes.

6
00:12.600 --> 00:14.740
Coming from classification.

7
00:14.910 --> 00:21.570
So if you take anything in the world you can say that this belongs to so-and-so class so you can categorize

8
00:21.660 --> 00:22.300
everything.

9
00:23.010 --> 00:23.770
Yes.

10
00:23.820 --> 00:31.200
So if you take a group of people at a college then you can say that these students belongs to computer

11
00:31.190 --> 00:31.980
science.

12
00:32.130 --> 00:37.690
So this is a class of computer science and this student belongs to electronics so this is the class of electronics.

13
00:37.690 --> 00:43.500
So you're classifying based on the subject or the course they are going through. it means that classification

14
00:43.500 --> 00:46.050
is based on the criteria that you are adopting.

15
00:46.560 --> 00:51.060
So you are grouping set of students based on their course.

16
00:51.060 --> 00:55.360
So does a class for computer science and the class for electronics.

17
00:55.440 --> 01:02.500
But if you see the students both electronic and these are students only, so students are again a class.

18
01:02.570 --> 01:04.130
There's is one of the classification.

19
01:04.200 --> 01:05.110
These are the students.

20
01:05.130 --> 01:06.210
These are the employees.

21
01:06.210 --> 01:13.920
this is one classification categorization, then both students and employees are human beings.

22
01:13.940 --> 01:19.040
So yes again there is a classification, these are human beings and these are birds and these are

23
01:19.040 --> 01:20.120
reptiles.

24
01:20.150 --> 01:21.620
So there are many classes.

25
01:21.620 --> 01:27.230
So classification is based on some criteria or the common things that you find in them.

26
01:27.430 --> 01:27.750
Right.

27
01:28.130 --> 01:31.920
So we define classes in our daily life.

28
01:32.030 --> 01:38.210
Any 4 wheel vehicle in which there is a driver and some people are sitting at the back or beside

29
01:38.210 --> 01:39.980
the driver then we say it's a car.

30
01:40.520 --> 01:43.470
If that are groups loaded at the back then we say it's a truck.

31
01:44.330 --> 01:49.730
So this is the classification depend on the property we are defining that this is a truck this is a car and

32
01:49.760 --> 01:52.610
and both are vehicle again, so vehicle is again a class.

33
01:52.610 --> 01:59.690
So in this way, if I take examples like human beings human being is a class.

34
01:59.780 --> 02:07.120
So there's a class human and you are an object of human being class.

35
02:07.280 --> 02:15.850
and myself as an object of human being class and a class car.

36
02:17.030 --> 02:25.820
So BMW X1 I guess it's a car and Camry Toyota is also a car.

37
02:26.510 --> 02:30.190
So this is an object of a car.

38
02:30.240 --> 02:32.910
This is an object of a car.

39
02:32.960 --> 02:39.110
This is a class, so looking at the objects we classify like looking at me you can you can say he is a human.

40
02:39.110 --> 02:43.080
So what I'm, I'm  a object and what you said human.

41
02:43.220 --> 02:46.420
That is a class looking at this camry.

42
02:46.430 --> 02:47.750
You said it's a car.

43
02:47.900 --> 02:49.570
So this is an object.

44
02:49.880 --> 02:51.890
And this is the definition that you're using.

45
02:51.890 --> 02:53.060
You are using the class name.

46
02:53.300 --> 02:57.170
So class is a definition and object is an instance.

47
02:57.200 --> 02:57.600
Now.

48
02:57.650 --> 03:05.350
Let us take example, suppose a civil engineer has made a plan of a house.

49
03:06.000 --> 03:08.600
These are rooms in that house

50
03:15.670 --> 03:19.770
so he made a plan of a house. this in entrance of house.

51
03:19.980 --> 03:23.620
now a civil engineer has made this  plan.

52
03:24.510 --> 03:31.090
So suppose the civil engineer is making this plan for making quarters or houses for the employees of some

53
03:31.240 --> 03:32.380
organization.

54
03:32.380 --> 03:37.540
So some organization is making a colony or courthouse for their employees.

55
03:37.540 --> 03:39.410
Then they have approved this plan.

56
03:39.430 --> 03:43.760
Then based on this plan all the houses are constructed.

57
03:43.780 --> 03:47.360
There are many houses constructed based on this plan.

58
03:47.380 --> 03:52.780
Some companies provide housing facilities for their employees so they will have some cargo or apartments

59
03:52.780 --> 03:55.810
or independent houses or apartments.

60
03:55.970 --> 03:59.320
All the apartments will be similar only they follow the same design.

61
03:59.650 --> 04:06.130
So design is one and these are the houses or the apartments or the flats that are based on this

62
04:06.130 --> 04:06.820
design.

63
04:07.120 --> 04:17.290
So this design or the definition is nothing but class and these are objects these are objects.

64
04:17.290 --> 04:19.810
These houses are constructed based on this one.

65
04:19.810 --> 04:20.960
So what is this.

66
04:20.980 --> 04:26.710
This is nothing but blueprint of this object.

67
04:27.490 --> 04:32.730
So this will be having all those things that are defined here in the plan so that's it so civil engineer

68
04:32.730 --> 04:33.700
will make this one.

69
04:33.760 --> 04:36.210
And based on this construction is done.

70
04:36.540 --> 04:45.220
Now let's take another example suppose an electronics engineer is making a design of a fingerprint scanner

71
04:45.580 --> 04:50.800
and for fingerprint scanner he made a design and this is a circuit diagram just imagine that is the

72
04:50.800 --> 04:52.530
circuit diagram.

73
04:52.540 --> 04:53.250
OK.

74
04:53.360 --> 04:55.780
Some ices are there on this one.

75
04:55.780 --> 04:58.040
So he made some circuit diagram for this one.

76
04:58.930 --> 05:00.730
So there's a circuit diagram.

77
05:00.790 --> 05:05.750
Now this is a thumb scanner or fingerprint scanner.

78
05:06.140 --> 05:08.660
And this is another fingerprint scanner.

79
05:09.150 --> 05:11.670
And this is another fingerprint scanner

80
05:14.880 --> 05:19.380
all  these fingerprint scanners are based on this design.

81
05:19.410 --> 05:27.030
So this is a class or this is a blueprint of a fingerprint scanner.

82
05:27.030 --> 05:34.500
So what all these are? these are objects, these are all objects of that design.

83
05:34.500 --> 05:35.670
Based on that design.

84
05:36.090 --> 05:43.470
So every engineer does some paperwork or designing work and based on that design the manufacturing

85
05:43.470 --> 05:45.060
is done following that design.

86
05:45.390 --> 05:49.650
So when you make a product, that product will be having all those things that are there in the design

87
05:49.920 --> 05:56.110
and you can then make many products based on that design. a car company will design a new car.

88
05:56.340 --> 05:59.690
Then they will manufacture many cars based on that design.

89
06:00.750 --> 06:07.470
So all those cars are object and the design that company is holding with it is a class. that's it.

90
06:07.680 --> 06:12.880
So Same way we also want to write a class and create objects in our program.

91
06:13.320 --> 06:14.970
So how do you define a class.

92
06:14.970 --> 06:16.400
What will be there in the class.

93
06:16.410 --> 06:17.780
What do you will use.

94
06:17.940 --> 06:21.680
Here we use ices and boards and pins.

95
06:21.770 --> 06:29.970
Then in the house example there will be walls and pillars and roof then, what's will be in your class

96
06:30.360 --> 06:31.380
in our classes.

97
06:31.380 --> 06:32.100
What will be there.

98
06:32.160 --> 06:34.620
I'll show you. our classes.

99
06:34.650 --> 06:40.380
See our product, that is software is related to computation its related to computation.

100
06:40.380 --> 06:46.670
So we are making a classes that are more related to computation so suppose I want to have a class for

101
06:46.680 --> 06:48.050
rectangle.

102
06:48.060 --> 06:50.610
Then I will see a rectangle class

103
06:53.920 --> 06:55.150
then what it will contain.

104
06:55.480 --> 06:58.580
So as we are related to computation needs data.

105
06:58.590 --> 07:01.570
So we'll have only two things, data and the functions.

106
07:01.570 --> 07:05.240
So our class will contain data and functions.

107
07:05.260 --> 07:10.680
So data is called as property and function is called as behavior.

108
07:10.690 --> 07:15.430
So what is the data required for rectangle so rectangle will have length and breadth.

109
07:15.540 --> 07:22.660
So we will have a data that is float length and float.

110
07:23.950 --> 07:24.400
breadth

111
07:27.190 --> 07:28.660
this is about data.

112
07:28.900 --> 07:31.780
Then what are the function computations we can do.

113
07:31.780 --> 07:36.690
We can find area of a rectangle and this should give us the float result.

114
07:37.110 --> 07:43.480
And we can find perimeter of a rectangle this also gets a float result.

115
07:43.890 --> 07:50.300
we can find diagonal  of a rectangle, means there is a diagram of a rectangle.

116
07:50.320 --> 07:54.130
This also gets floated result and so on.

117
07:54.130 --> 07:58.340
So these are set of functions and this is the data.

118
07:58.420 --> 08:05.350
So if you say data and the functions so now anything in the world you can define in terms of data and

119
08:05.350 --> 08:07.570
its function if it is useful for you.

120
08:08.800 --> 08:10.690
So this a class, this is the class.

121
08:10.780 --> 08:13.460
I have not written a complete class I have not written the detail.

122
08:13.480 --> 08:15.900
So this is more abstract, abstract.

123
08:16.290 --> 08:16.630
Now

124
08:19.840 --> 08:21.520
I will create an object rectangle, 

125
08:21.550 --> 08:27.510
r one, r two, r three.

126
08:27.750 --> 08:37.170
So these are objects, what this r1will have, length breadth and area perimetre and so on and so functions

127
08:37.500 --> 08:39.330
r2 will also have length breadth and these functions.

128
08:39.330 --> 08:45.360
r3, all these objects will have samething like of fingerprint scanner was having

129
08:45.360 --> 08:50.910
everything what was there in their design and a house was having all the rooms and leaving the hall everything

130
08:50.910 --> 08:52.390
what was there in their design.

131
08:52.500 --> 08:59.240
So same way this rectangular object is having everything whatever it is given in this design. that's

132
08:59.370 --> 08:59.650
it.

133
08:59.690 --> 09:06.050
This is how you write the classes, we can write down the class for anything in the world.

134
09:06.080 --> 09:13.040
So mostly what type of things we deal in our programming for that we can see it as a object unfold file

135
09:13.140 --> 09:17.070
we can  define it as a class and based on the class we can create an object and use it.

136
09:17.910 --> 09:24.630
So in programming we define this class and keep it, and in our program, actually program, let us say main function

137
09:24.630 --> 09:26.430
and other set of functions.

138
09:26.430 --> 09:31.950
they will be using these objects and they will be using these objects so were to write the class, shall

139
09:31.950 --> 09:33.660
we write it somewhere else and use it.

140
09:33.680 --> 09:33.920
Yes.

141
09:33.990 --> 09:40.440
If you want. mostly in program we write in the same program with the class and there only we will use it.

142
09:40.470 --> 09:44.510
this is our practise, otherwise you can write on some set of classes and keep them in some header file

143
09:44.600 --> 09:48.740
files and you can include the header file and used objects of a class.

144
09:49.080 --> 09:54.380
So defining a class is different and creating its object and using it as different.

145
09:54.390 --> 09:58.980
So let us say this I am doing this inside the main function.

146
09:59.850 --> 10:01.600
and This is a defined here.

147
10:02.010 --> 10:07.700
So mostly as a programmer we write class on the main function there only, get confused little bit.

148
10:07.730 --> 10:12.900
But it's not like that, like design separate so who will have that design engineer will have

149
10:12.900 --> 10:20.010
the design and he will construct houses right everything about the design engineer knows and based on that

150
10:20.040 --> 10:25.530
the houses are constructed and a electronic engineer  will have the design and the manufacturing of

151
10:25.530 --> 10:27.240
the product is done based on that design.

152
10:27.900 --> 10:34.800
So designing work is different and manufacturing and using the devices based on that design is different.

153
10:34.890 --> 10:41.040
So same way writing a class is a different work, using a class is a different work if you mix them

154
10:41.040 --> 10:46.950
then you confuse Why the hell I am writting all these things, no writing the class complete the design

155
10:47.190 --> 10:48.600
then use them.

156
10:49.200 --> 10:52.710
So that's all I have given you the difference between class and an object.

157
10:52.710 --> 10:56.300
So we have defined a class based on the data and the functions.

158
10:56.310 --> 10:58.750
And here we create object and use it.

159
10:59.250 --> 11:05.310
So the next video I'll show you the syntax how we define the class how to create object how do you use

160
11:05.310 --> 11:06.570
members of an object.
