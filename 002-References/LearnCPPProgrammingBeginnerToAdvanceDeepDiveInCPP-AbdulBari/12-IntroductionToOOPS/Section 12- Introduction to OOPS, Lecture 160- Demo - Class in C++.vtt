Write a class for a rectangle, class Rectangle.

1
00:05.340 --> 00:15.020
Now here I will make everything public an integer length integer Breadth.

2
00:15.360 --> 00:21.890
Then I will define area function and perimeter function integer area.

3
00:21.990 --> 00:26.630
Now there's a simple function which returns length into breadth.

4
00:27.020 --> 00:38.530
perimeter returns 2X length plus breadth that's it, this is a complete class for rectangle.

5
00:38.640 --> 00:40.530
There's a class for rectangle.

6
00:40.620 --> 00:48.650
So I have a class for rectangle having data member length and breadth and member functions are area

7
00:48.700 --> 00:49.730
and perimeter.

8
00:50.100 --> 00:54.660
Now let us create the objects of rectangles and use them.

9
00:54.660 --> 01:04.310
So here inside the main function I will create an object of rectangle rone then r1.length  assign

10
01:04.320 --> 01:09.620
10 then r1.breadth assign 5.

11
01:09.710 --> 01:15.550
Now I will call area function by using dot operator we can access all the members.

12
01:15.870 --> 01:28.500
So call area function it should display area here write I write a message area is Re of a rectangle.

13
01:28.550 --> 01:35.160
Then also I will display perimeter is r1.perimeter.

14
01:35.210 --> 01:41.840
So here I am creating an object of rectangle setting its length and breadth and calling the functions

15
01:42.140 --> 01:43.370
and perimeter.

16
01:43.670 --> 01:50.120
So object of rectangle will have a length and breadth as data members and I can call these functions

17
01:50.150 --> 01:58.010
which will give me an area and perimeter for rectangle so for ten,5 area should be 50 and the

18
01:58.010 --> 01:59.770
perimeters should be 30.

19
01:59.780 --> 02:01.500
Let us run this and see.

20
02:01.670 --> 02:04.460
Yes five and thirty.

21
02:04.490 --> 02:08.440
So this was the first program using classes.

22
02:08.510 --> 02:10.150
So the things to take care in the beginning.

23
02:10.160 --> 02:15.500
I made everything as public and here after the class I should make semi-colon this is mandatory.

24
02:15.680 --> 02:20.930
So without semi-colon it is an error and dot operator is used for accessing the member.

25
02:20.930 --> 02:24.530
So I have access length breadth as well as area and perimeter.
