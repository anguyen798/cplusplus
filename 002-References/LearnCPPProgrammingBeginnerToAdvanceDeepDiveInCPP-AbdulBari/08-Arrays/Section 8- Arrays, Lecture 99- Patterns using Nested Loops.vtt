00:00.390 --> 00:06.120
Let us write programs for displaying various patterns using for loop already you

1
00:06.120 --> 00:07.090
have seen this code.

2
00:07.110 --> 00:15.780
So instead of displaying i and j values I'll just remove this and even say cout  star than space and

3
00:15.780 --> 00:16.660
close the one.

4
00:16.680 --> 00:19.200
So Star and space will be displayed.

5
00:19.200 --> 00:24.580
And you know this cout will move to next line after every row.

6
00:24.660 --> 00:27.150
Let us show this.

7
00:27.500 --> 00:31.100
I'm getting a square patterns of three stars each.

8
00:31.130 --> 00:37.020
So I just increase this to five and let us run again.

9
00:40.370 --> 00:46.880
So I'm getting a square pattern of five by five stars.

10
00:46.880 --> 00:49.100
Now here I'll make a small change.

11
00:49.100 --> 00:53.590
J is starting from 1 and j is less than or equal to 5.

12
00:53.790 --> 00:56.420
I will say less than or equal to i

13
00:56.570 --> 01:02.250
So I initially one so it is repeated for innner for loop is repeated for only one time.

14
01:02.420 --> 01:08.360
Then next two times then three time so whatever the value of i is it will be for that many times not always

15
01:08.360 --> 01:11.390
five times what pattern we get

16
01:14.080 --> 01:14.550
OK.

17
01:14.560 --> 01:16.040
I'm getting a triangle.

18
01:16.240 --> 01:23.670
There's one star and two stars next lined and three stars and next line and so on.

19
01:23.690 --> 01:29.790
Now instead of this if I say five minus i.

20
01:30.200 --> 01:32.040
Then let us see what happens.

21
01:35.110 --> 01:41.440
I'm getting this triangle but I'm getting just four so I should write five minus I plus one so I'll be

22
01:41.440 --> 01:45.560
getting it 5 4 3 2 1 so let me change this 5 minus i.

23
01:45.570 --> 01:47.020
I plus one

24
01:51.130 --> 01:55.660
so I got a triangle of stars right.

25
01:55.710 --> 02:01.830
So I got two shapes you have seen, now i will make some changes and display  this star based on condition.

26
02:01.830 --> 02:03.320
So just watch this one.

27
02:03.330 --> 02:05.160
So now it is a square.

28
02:05.160 --> 02:06.780
This is exactly the first one.

29
02:06.780 --> 02:09.250
That is square of size 5.

30
02:09.300 --> 02:21.610
But now here I will write if I plus j is less than 5 then displayed this star.

31
02:21.660 --> 02:24.280
Otherwise else

32
02:24.870 --> 02:32.200
cout just give two spaces.

33
02:32.310 --> 02:33.220
That's it.

34
02:33.230 --> 02:34.960
So I have made changes here.

35
02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
I'm not displaying star every time.

36
02:37.010 --> 02:42.700
I'm also displaying a space when this condition is true it will be showing star.

37
02:42.710 --> 02:45.160
Otherwise it will be showing space.

38
02:45.180 --> 02:47.410
Just watch what happens.

39
02:48.350 --> 02:49.540
I'll change this condition.

40
02:49.550 --> 02:52.440
That is I plus j is greater than 5.

41
02:52.610 --> 02:53.630
Then display this

42
02:57.210 --> 03:00.530
see i got a right bottom side of our triangle.

43
03:01.050 --> 03:07.860
If I say I is less than j then only print  this one.

44
03:07.860 --> 03:09.840
Let us see what you get.

45
03:12.930 --> 03:14.950
I got only a few stars.

46
03:14.950 --> 03:19.050
One started iS less so I will say I is less than or equal to j

47
03:23.600 --> 03:28.100
now on the top right side of a triangle.

48
03:28.240 --> 03:34.420
So initially when you saw that this was from 5 to 5 so I was getting a square of 5 by 5.

49
03:34.720 --> 03:37.290
Now these locations are filled with spaces.

50
03:37.330 --> 03:44.000
These are all spaces and these are stars so it is displaying stars or spaces depending on the condition met.

51
03:44.590 --> 03:46.280
So in this way you can play around with these i & j.

52
03:46.290 --> 03:52.300
values and you can get different stars and this will help you to develop your logic so

53
03:52.300 --> 03:55.830
different designs you can make using stars or even you can use number.
