Yah here is an exercise program for multiplication of to matrices.

1
00:06.060 --> 00:10.770
So in this program you have to take out two dimensional array for each metrics and you have to take

2
00:10.780 --> 00:12.840
two matrices and multiply them.

3
00:12.840 --> 00:16.820
So for multiplication of matrices you should know what is the formula for multiplying the matrices

4
00:16.950 --> 00:18.750
you should find that formula.

5
00:19.300 --> 00:25.060
Here I will run the program and show you what should be the input and output of a program and even a program

6
00:25.060 --> 00:28.010
file is given in the form of PDF in resource.

7
00:28.260 --> 00:31.470
So if you're facing any difficulty you can check the program.

8
00:31.980 --> 00:36.840
I have a program for matrix multiplication I will run the program and show you how the program should

9
00:36.840 --> 00:42.910
run. See First it is asking the number of rows and columns for first matrix.

10
00:42.940 --> 00:48.210
I'll give the dimensions as 2 and 2 that is 2x2  matrix.

11
00:48.220 --> 00:50.830
Then the second Matrix is also two by two.

12
00:51.130 --> 00:57.550
So the first matrix elements I'll give it as three and three that is first row and three and three

13
00:57.550 --> 00:58.760
that is second row.

14
00:59.110 --> 01:05.550
Now for the second matix I will giveit as 1 0 and 0 1 this is a identity matrix if I give identity matrix

15
01:05.560 --> 01:15.090
I should get the same result that this 3 3 3, yah i got the answer 3 3 3 3.

16
01:15.220 --> 01:18.040
So this is working and if I read rerun and show you

17
01:21.050 --> 01:24.840
I'll give the first matrix dimensions as 2 x 3.

18
01:24.930 --> 01:29.550
And the second matixs dimension also two x three matrices cannot be multiplied because the

19
01:29.550 --> 01:34.450
number of columns of first matrix should be equal the number of rows of second matrix,  if i run this.

20
01:34.440 --> 01:39.780
Then I got an error message that columns of the first Matrix is not equal  rows of second matix.

21
01:39.810 --> 01:44.940
So that's how the program should verify whether the matrices can be multiplied or not.

22
01:44.940 --> 01:50.310
So the matrices can be multiplied if the number of columns of first matrix is equal to the number of rows

23
01:50.310 --> 01:52.310
of second matrix.

24
01:52.380 --> 02:00.510
And if the valid dimension are given and then it should take the elements and multiply them.

25
02:00.510 --> 02:03.940
So if I am giving the elements as 2 and 2.

26
02:04.050 --> 02:07.110
So all elements has two then for the second matix.

27
02:07.140 --> 02:12.770
I'll give it as a unity identity matrix that is 1 0 and 0 1.

28
02:13.050 --> 02:15.530
So I've got the same matrix as first matrix.

29
02:15.540 --> 02:18.440
So the answer is all twos.

30
02:18.570 --> 02:20.690
So this is how your program should work.

31
02:20.810 --> 02:21.170
Right.

32
02:21.180 --> 02:26.110
Take the dimensions of two matrices and take the elements and then multiply them.

33
02:26.190 --> 02:32.530
So here more focus is on the writing nested for loops and taking two dimensional arrays.

34
02:32.760 --> 02:37.000
So try this program already i  have shown you addition and subtraction of matrices.

35
02:37.020 --> 02:41.960
So based on that just you have to know which is the formula for multiplying two matrices.

36
02:41.970 --> 02:43.200
So find  out the formula.

37
02:43.200 --> 02:43.410
write 

38
02:43.410 --> 02:48.840
The problem in case of any difficulty you can check the pdf file.
