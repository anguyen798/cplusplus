Here's the exercise program for calculating average of all the elements in an array.

1
00:06.900 --> 00:12.900
So you are supposed to take the list of elements as an input in an array and then calculate the average

2
00:12.990 --> 00:15.940
amount of all those elements.

3
00:15.960 --> 00:22.110
So this program uses an array here I will show you how the program should run, what should be the input and what

4
00:22.110 --> 00:27.630
should be the output, and a program file is given in the resource if you face any difficulty then you

5
00:27.630 --> 00:30.360
can check that program code.

6
00:30.880 --> 00:31.260
Yeah.

7
00:31.260 --> 00:35.810
Here is a program for finding the average of elements from an array.

8
00:35.970 --> 00:41.530
I will run the program and show you it's asking the number of elements.

9
00:41.550 --> 00:49.480
so I Will say there are five elements and the elements are 10 and 20 30 40 and 50.

10
00:49.530 --> 00:52.300
So the average of all these elements is 30.

11
00:52.320 --> 00:53.980
So the output is given here.

12
00:54.210 --> 00:59.010
So you are supposed to take the no. of elements and then read all the elements and you have to keep

13
00:59.010 --> 01:00.910
all these elements in an array.

14
01:00.930 --> 01:05.880
So the main important thing in the program is to store the elements in an array and from the array you have

15
01:05.880 --> 01:10.700
to iterate through all the elements using for loop and find out sum.

16
01:10.710 --> 01:17.750
And then you can calculate average by dividing the sum of the elements by number of elements.

17
01:18.150 --> 01:23.550
So try this for program it is based on arrays and even the program file is available as pdf.
