Let us write programs for finding addition of two matrices.

1
00:05.050 --> 00:16.100
So for matrices I will take two matrices of order two by three I will directly initialize the values

2
00:16.160 --> 00:21.810
that is 3 3 3 3 3 3.

3
00:21.920 --> 00:22.770
So all values 

4
00:22.820 --> 00:29.810
I have taken same, I will take one more array B of same dimension because the addition and subtraction can be done

5
00:29.840 --> 00:32.260
Only if the dimensions are same.

6
00:32.660 --> 00:40.520
And here I will take all the values as one so that will be easy for us to verify our results, then i am taking

7
00:40.520 --> 00:50.440
one more array C of size same two by three and this is empty.

8
00:50.510 --> 00:56.460
Now for generating matrix C by adding the elements of A and B I need nested for loop.

9
00:56.480 --> 01:05.450
So using nested for loop, I'll go through all the elements of C first for loop, for I assigned zero and I is less than

10
01:05.480 --> 01:10.620
2 I plus plus, and one more for loop in here.

11
01:10.640 --> 01:14.990
I will use j, j assign zero.

12
01:15.140 --> 01:17.690
j is Less than three J plus plus

13
01:24.300 --> 01:27.430
I will close these loops here.

14
01:27.460 --> 01:37.150
I will say c of every i and j should be assigned with each of i and j.

15
01:37.150 --> 01:45.790
Plus B of I and j, elements of A and B are the corresponding location.

16
01:45.820 --> 01:47.920
I , j are added.

17
01:47.980 --> 01:55.250
And the result is stored in C of i&j. after adding these two matrices I want to see the output so for output

18
01:55.260 --> 02:00.030
again I need two for loop so I'll copy this and I'll paste them here.

19
02:04.430 --> 02:09.520
And instead of adding I will display the elements of c matrix

20
02:09.580 --> 02:18.910
cout  C[i][j] I'll give the element and between every element I need some space so let us

21
02:18.920 --> 02:27.370
give a space and after the end of each row I should go to the next line that is endl, now this for loop is

22
02:27.510 --> 02:30.110
for displaying C-Matrix.

23
02:30.170 --> 02:35.740
And these nested for loops are for adding A and B and storing the result in C.

24
02:36.080 --> 02:39.400
So after adding I should get all elements as 4 4 4.

25
02:39.410 --> 02:40.880
So let us see what the output

26
02:44.260 --> 02:44.710
Yeah.

27
02:44.750 --> 02:46.240
And 4 4 4.

28
02:46.590 --> 02:49.650
That's it.

29
02:49.650 --> 02:55.860
If I want to make a program for subtracting two matrixes just here at this place,

30
02:55.890 --> 02:59.950
I should make a change as minus and everything is same.

31
02:59.970 --> 03:04.000
So this should become 2 2 for all the elements.

32
03:06.950 --> 03:09.370
So you get all the elements has two.

33
03:09.650 --> 03:10.410
So that's it.

34
03:10.430 --> 03:12.770
So I have shown you addition and subtraction.

35
03:12.770 --> 03:19.460
So you find out how to do multiplication of two matrices and that is a challenge for you for finding

36
03:19.460 --> 03:21.280
multiplication of two matrices.
