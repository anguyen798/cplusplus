00:01.650 --> 00:08.590
Now let us write a program for finding a maximum element in an Array. that is the largest element in an

1
00:08.670 --> 00:09.040
Array.

2
00:09.740 --> 00:15.320
So already I have an Array with me with some elements some from that I have to find out maximum.

3
00:15.520 --> 00:20.470
I will do it once more just watch it how we do, what is our  procedure if you observe this procedure

4
00:20.500 --> 00:22.200
then you can convert it into a program.

5
00:22.300 --> 00:26.960
Observe it.first is 4, then 8, oh 8 is 

6
00:27.010 --> 00:29.450
greater than four, so eight

7
00:29.820 --> 00:33.730
then the 9,  9 is greater than 8 na.

8
00:33.730 --> 00:34.380
That is greater.

9
00:34.440 --> 00:36.430
Yes 9.

10
00:36.460 --> 00:38.070
This is smaller then leave it, 

11
00:38.080 --> 00:40.940
This is smaller then this is also smaller then leave it

12
00:41.000 --> 00:43.250
So what are the last number 9.

13
00:43.270 --> 00:46.150
So we should remember what is the largest right now with us.

14
00:46.270 --> 00:48.610
Let's go on comparing with all the elements.

15
00:48.610 --> 00:50.410
This is a simple procedure.

16
00:50.410 --> 00:51.100
Let us do it.

17
00:51.310 --> 00:53.140
I have the list of elements here.

18
00:53.140 --> 00:55.310
Let us do the same thing here.

19
00:55.330 --> 00:56.140
I will do it.

20
00:56.140 --> 01:01.650
So initially first element  you leave it because Max is four the maximum element that you want to find out

21
01:01.660 --> 01:05.440
is four now let us do that with that one, 8.

22
01:05.560 --> 01:06.990
Is it a greater than four?.

23
01:07.000 --> 01:07.560
Yes.

24
01:07.570 --> 01:09.930
So change it to 8 then 6.

25
01:09.940 --> 01:10.930
Is it greater than max.

26
01:10.930 --> 01:11.460
No.

27
01:11.470 --> 01:13.720
Don't change it, is it greater than Max.

28
01:13.750 --> 01:14.140
Yes.

29
01:14.140 --> 01:16.380
So change it to nine, then five.

30
01:16.380 --> 01:17.560
Is it greater than nine.

31
01:17.560 --> 01:18.700
No.

32
01:18.700 --> 01:20.530
2 Is it to get to the max 9.

33
01:20.530 --> 01:21.100
No.

34
01:21.100 --> 01:21.670
7.

35
01:21.670 --> 01:22.810
Is it better than Max.

36
01:22.810 --> 01:24.290
no leave it.

37
01:24.310 --> 01:27.880
So what is the last value that is updated in Max that is 9.

38
01:28.600 --> 01:29.380
So that's it.

39
01:29.380 --> 01:32.710
So you need some value that you have to remember which is the maximum.

40
01:32.710 --> 01:38.890
So initially you'll make it as 4 so maximum is what? four. initially it is 4, then you will see that 8

41
01:38.890 --> 01:45.300
is greater then 4, so change it. then 6 is not greater let it be eight only, then 9 is greater than 8.

42
01:45.340 --> 01:47.830
So change it.  5 is not greater than 9.

43
01:48.130 --> 01:53.090
Let it be 9 only, 2 is not greater,let it be 9 only. 7 is not greater, let it be nine only.

44
01:53.230 --> 01:58.070
So this is how you can maintain the value of Max that will give us the back maximum element.

45
01:58.120 --> 01:59.510
So what we were doing here.

46
01:59.530 --> 02:10.610
We were checking that if A[i] is greater than maximum then change Max to A[i], this is

47
02:10.630 --> 02:14.960
the procedure we are storing that A[i] in Max.

48
02:15.070 --> 02:18.570
So we have to scans all the elements and every time check with the max.

49
02:18.580 --> 02:21.010
So initially Max will have the first value.

50
02:21.070 --> 02:24.520
So basically we should start from the second value onwards from here.

51
02:24.670 --> 02:27.070
That is index 1 onwards.

52
02:27.070 --> 02:28.850
So these are the repeating steps.

53
02:28.870 --> 02:35.640
Let us write a program for that one. already I have an Array and n for the number of elements.

54
02:35.800 --> 02:38.530
Then I should have a max. And here,

55
02:38.530 --> 02:45.130
The first step what I will do is Max assign A of 0 that is 0th element I have taken, that is I said this element

56
02:45.130 --> 02:47.120
will take it, 4 we will take it now.

57
02:47.190 --> 02:52.770
Next I have to go on checking thi is a repeating process so this I can do it in the for loop repeating

58
02:52.780 --> 02:58.430
procedure. for I assign one onwards, I said we will start comparing from here if it start from zero

59
02:58.430 --> 03:04.960
also nothing will happen right because 4 is not a greater than Four, nothing will happen, then i is less

60
03:04.960 --> 03:07.850
than 7 then i plus plus.

61
03:08.060 --> 03:12.960
Then while scanning through an array one by one what  I have to do, check the that one.

62
03:13.120 --> 03:27.790
If A of I is greater than Max, change Max to A[i] right that's all. this is the

63
03:27.790 --> 03:35.370
only thing that really we will be doing inside the for loop then afterwards print maximum element is, right

64
03:35.800 --> 03:37.420
maximum number is

65
03:40.390 --> 03:48.030
the value that we got in Max. that's it and then returns zero, you know that well.

66
03:48.070 --> 03:49.890
So this is the program for finding maximum.

67
03:49.900 --> 03:54.510
So for this actually we have prepared this table and observed it's working.

68
03:54.640 --> 03:57.910
And based on the working we have written the program code right.

69
03:58.240 --> 04:03.460
So if you are a beginner if you are learning how to write programs then this type of work is very important

70
04:03.460 --> 04:04.140
for you.

71
04:04.210 --> 04:09.000
If you tried to directly jump here and tried to write something and expect correct results.

72
04:09.040 --> 04:10.540
You may not get it.

73
04:10.540 --> 04:12.620
You should get the correct result on paper.

74
04:12.700 --> 04:14.380
You should know what you are writing.

75
04:14.560 --> 04:15.820
right, what you are writing.

76
04:15.820 --> 04:20.810
So if you do some paperwork that will tell you whether your steps are perfect or not.

77
04:20.920 --> 04:23.940
Then you can do this one and one more interesting thing.

78
04:24.090 --> 04:31.060
If this is the program in front of you want to know how this program works then this board you can see this

79
04:31.060 --> 04:33.080
you can say tracing of a program.

80
04:33.130 --> 04:37.790
So first we have done a tracing then from there we write the program this is the right method.

81
04:37.990 --> 04:42.220
If you have not written the program, it is somebody else program somebody else has written it.

82
04:42.400 --> 04:46.300
Then you can understand it how it is working by making a table like this.

83
04:46.360 --> 04:51.460
So that's all there is a coding available for finding the maximum number so you finish

84
04:51.460 --> 04:55.120
that exercise and that you have to write down few statements not everything.

85
04:55.570 --> 04:56.840
And one more thing.

86
04:56.860 --> 04:59.120
The demo is also available, watch that demo.

87
04:59.120 --> 05:00.520
Write the program by yourself.

88
05:00.520 --> 05:03.180
So before watching demo, write the program by yourself. on your P.C.

89
05:03.180 --> 05:04.540
or  your laptop.

90
05:04.960 --> 05:10.390
If you get any errors any problem then you can check the demo and remove any errors.

91
05:10.390 --> 05:12.780
No I don't think you will get any errors.

92
05:12.790 --> 05:13.930
Everything is there on board.

93
05:14.260 --> 05:16.030
So just copy this and write it

94
05:16.030 --> 05:17.340
By yourself.

95
05:17.580 --> 05:18.090
That's all.

96
05:18.090 --> 05:21.100
So we'll see more programs on this.
