In this video we will see how to display some patterns on the screen using Nested for loop

1
00:05.940 --> 00:07.670
already in the previous video I have shown you one pattern.

2
00:07.710 --> 00:13.200
Now in this video I will show you two patterns that are sufficient for making various type of patterns.

3
00:13.230 --> 00:15.080
So first one is this fun.

4
00:15.450 --> 00:16.770
I want to draw astricks.

5
00:16.800 --> 00:22.830
I don't want to box just I want to display astricks so I'm comparing them with i&j values.

6
00:23.010 --> 00:25.580
OK so I want to display astricks.

7
00:25.860 --> 00:29.230
So these two nested for loop,

8
00:29.740 --> 00:37.980
will give us all these values of box like 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 2 0  so on.

9
00:38.220 --> 00:41.660
So I get all those locations right.

10
00:41.760 --> 00:43.690
We get all the values of  i&j.

11
00:43.770 --> 00:46.400
We don't want to print a star every time.

12
00:46.520 --> 00:52.590
Then when we want to print star, we want to print only these places then how to recognize how to identify

13
00:52.590 --> 00:53.580
these places.

14
00:53.640 --> 00:55.790
Soi and j should help us.

15
00:55.950 --> 00:56.700
Let us check.

16
00:56.790 --> 01:09.410
i& j,  this one, 00 this one 10, i is 1  j is 0, i is 1 j is 1  OK, I is 2 j is 0,i is 2 j is 1, i is 2 j is 2,

17
01:09.410 --> 01:14.550
so here if you observe I is greater than J right.

18
01:14.640 --> 01:16.430
Greater than or equal to j.

19
01:16.590 --> 01:24.610
And this empty places if you observe I is  zero j is a three I is zero and j is 2 so there J is Greater

20
01:24.660 --> 01:31.110
so when I have to bring this one if I is a greater than or equal to J print star otherwise don't print

21
01:31.110 --> 01:31.520
star.

22
01:31.770 --> 01:37.020
So here I have already explained you this nested for loop endl also  already i have explained

23
01:37.260 --> 01:48.000
so just I have to write on something here if I is greater than or equal to j then see out star this

24
01:48.000 --> 01:52.980
is how star is displayed. we want star  side by side only, no need of spaces if you want

25
01:52.990 --> 01:55.290
spaces then you can give a gap here.

26
01:55.410 --> 01:57.730
So just one space gap then give codes.

27
01:57.870 --> 02:03.740
So it will give a gap in between the stars so we get this shape that's all.

28
02:03.880 --> 02:09.310
So right down this inside the main function you have to declare this i and j  values, variables you have

29
02:09.310 --> 02:14.710
to declare than just inside the main function you write on  this code and it will run and you'll get this

30
02:14.800 --> 02:16.570
output on the screen.

31
02:16.990 --> 02:19.950
Now next I'll show you one more pattern in this video.

32
02:21.430 --> 02:25.690
Yeah another pattern. see this pattern I want. 

33
02:25.750 --> 02:28.460
So in this pattern if you observe stars are there.

34
02:28.580 --> 02:36.240
Okay no problem then space then stars are there, then again two spaces and stars are there 

35
02:36.330 --> 02:42.240
I should give spaces now star I have to print as well as the spaces, if I don't give a spaces this

36
02:42.240 --> 02:44.290
start will come in the beginning right.

37
02:44.370 --> 02:50.210
If you print it will print it in the corner of a screen if you see the screen like this then four stars are there

38
02:50.250 --> 02:56.160
ok 4 stars are printed.  then next i need a space then only  I should get a  star

39
02:56.280 --> 03:03.110
if I don't give space then this is Stars will start from here I want space so space and star so when to print

40
03:03.120 --> 03:13.770
space and when to print star so look at the spaces here 1 0 2 0 2 1 0 see diagonal means i and j are  equal

41
03:14.050 --> 03:20.550
and this lower diagonal part, this the lower triangular park I is greater than J 

42
03:20.880 --> 03:25.100
in the diagonal I & j are equal. so whenI is greater than J.

43
03:25.100 --> 03:30.240
We should give space otherwise give star, so it's simple.

44
03:30.240 --> 03:39.630
Now here I should write if I is greater than J then cout space so give quotes and gives space then

45
03:40.290 --> 03:47.340
else what i should print, star so I don't want to give space in between this stars.

46
03:47.760 --> 03:50.760
So this is for this space and this is for star,

47
03:51.240 --> 03:58.710
If I is greater than j as this portion right here I is equal to j then here I is less then G here

48
03:58.710 --> 04:00.560
I is than J, i is less than J.

49
04:00.710 --> 04:05.970
Then here I is greater than j  space then i Is equal to J sar.

50
04:05.970 --> 04:12.360
So this is how spaces and stars will give you that pattern. that's all in this video in the next video

51
04:12.360 --> 04:17.750
I'll show you one more pattern on a small example i will take and I will show you, so with this you can draw

52
04:17.760 --> 04:19.780
various other patterns as you like.

53
04:20.250 --> 04:23.580
So you try this, write a program and check it by yourself.

54
04:23.580 --> 04:26.750
I have just written for loop so inside main function you write them and run it.
