00:00.570 --> 00:06.120
Let us see the working of nested for loop that is for loop inside our for loop.

00:06.150 --> 00:09.450
I'll write first for loop for integer.

00:09.660 --> 00:11.850
I assign one.

00:11.850 --> 00:16.380
I'm starting from one and I is less than or equal to five.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.030
I plus.

00:18.030 --> 00:18.750
Plus.

00:20.780 --> 00:26.240
Now you know well that this loop will repeat four or five times where I will start taking the value

00:26.240 --> 00:28.310
from one and up to five.

00:28.310 --> 00:29.090
It will continue.

00:29.090 --> 00:32.090
When it becomes greater than five, it will stop.

00:32.390 --> 00:35.350
What I'll do is I'll see out I.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.720
And also after every I, I'll give some space.

00:39.980 --> 00:42.140
Let us run and see what happens.

00:45.380 --> 00:51.740
Displaying numbers from one through five instead of I, I will print.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.570
Star and the space.

00:56.580 --> 00:57.930
Let us see what I get.

01:01.700 --> 01:05.600
I got five stars with spaces in between them.

01:08.980 --> 01:14.420
Now here, I'll remove the code and I write one more follow up just like I.

01:14.440 --> 01:21.590
I will use J assign from one and J is less than or equal to five j plus plus.

01:22.420 --> 01:27.910
Now inside this loop I will say see out.

01:30.790 --> 01:34.360
G and I'll give some space.

01:35.710 --> 01:37.330
Let us see what happens.

01:38.200 --> 01:41.020
See, I have loop inside a loop.

01:41.020 --> 01:44.530
So this for loop is inside outer for loop.

01:45.610 --> 01:46.120
Right.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.950
So how many times it will repeat.

01:47.980 --> 01:54.760
Now in there for loop will j start from 1 to 5 and outer for loop also 1 to 5.

01:54.760 --> 02:01.690
So this inner for loop or this code will execute for 25 times five and to five times.

02:01.690 --> 02:05.170
So this j values I will get 25 g values.

02:05.170 --> 02:06.430
Let us run and see.

02:10.250 --> 02:11.120
Yes.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.590
1 to 5.

02:12.620 --> 02:14.320
Then again, 1 to 5.

02:14.330 --> 02:16.130
Then again, 1 to 5.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.180
1 to 5.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.400
So I got five times 1 to 5.

02:19.520 --> 02:21.170
They all are in a single line.

02:21.170 --> 02:22.340
So what I do is.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.850
This fall loop is displaying one line.

02:28.870 --> 02:34.180
After this I will say C out and L so that it moves into the next line.

02:34.420 --> 02:41.410
So in there for loop is for displaying one line and the outer for loop is for repeating those lines.

02:41.680 --> 02:42.730
Let us check.

02:45.090 --> 02:48.430
Yes in that follow up is displaying 1 to 5 first time.

02:48.450 --> 02:53.100
Then again next in that follow up is repeating for one more time and one more time.

02:53.100 --> 02:57.810
So it is totally repeating four or five times instead of just J.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.600
I will display both I and J.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.720
So I will try to include them inside a bracket.

03:03.720 --> 03:05.090
So there's a bracket.

03:05.100 --> 03:09.540
Then say I, then comma.

03:10.690 --> 03:14.890
Then Jay, then after that closing bracket.

03:15.070 --> 03:21.910
So I'm displaying both I and Jay with some space, and they're enclosed inside brackets.

03:22.420 --> 03:24.400
Let us see how we get the result.

03:27.970 --> 03:28.690
Yes.

03:28.690 --> 03:30.910
So now you can see that these are high values.

03:30.910 --> 03:33.570
First is high value and the second is g value.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.870
So I value is one.

03:34.870 --> 03:38.440
Then J is changing from 1 to 5 and this row.

03:38.710 --> 03:47.500
Then again I value the two and the j is taking the values from 1 to 5 for I values as three j is taking

03:47.500 --> 03:52.870
the values from 1 to 3, 4 to 5, and same way it is repeating up to five.

03:52.870 --> 03:54.790
So I got five squared.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.150
So it is just like a two dimensional array.

04:00.280 --> 04:04.060
If I take a matrix, then this is how we get the indices for the elements.

04:04.060 --> 04:08.380
One comma, one one comma to one comma, three one comma for one comma, five, then two comma, one

04:08.380 --> 04:09.610
to comma two so on.

04:10.690 --> 04:12.790
I try to change this from five.

04:12.790 --> 04:14.140
I will just make it as three.

04:14.140 --> 04:16.050
So it means I want just three rows.

04:16.060 --> 04:17.890
Let us see what output I get.

04:20.630 --> 04:25.700
C 1 to 5 G is taking values from 1 to 5, but is taking only three values.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.170
That is one, two, three.

04:27.830 --> 04:32.090
So that time I have taken square set of values, but now it is rectangular.

04:32.540 --> 04:35.720
Rows are three and columns are five.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.270
So if you check here, those are three and columns are five.

04:38.270 --> 04:42.380
So it means I is four rows and J is four columns.

04:43.970 --> 04:45.830
I will debug this and show you for this.

04:45.830 --> 04:48.410
I will change this g also to three.

04:48.410 --> 04:52.970
So I'll get just nine values three into three and let us run and see for that.

04:52.970 --> 04:57.050
I'll put a breakpoint on first for loop, then I will start running it.

05:00.110 --> 05:00.980
Yes.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.860
I values zero.

05:04.160 --> 05:04.740
Right.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.300
It is not yet executed.

05:06.320 --> 05:09.620
Then function seven.

05:09.620 --> 05:10.760
That is f seven.

05:11.360 --> 05:17.000
I value is one and the j value is still zero because this has not yet executed.

05:17.030 --> 05:18.350
Then next.

05:18.380 --> 05:19.990
Now it is on c out.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.430
I'll complete this and say next.

05:22.430 --> 05:28.370
So you can see that one comma one is displayed here, one comma one is displayed and the IMG values

05:28.370 --> 05:29.400
are one one.

05:29.420 --> 05:36.710
Now I will again press f seven so you can see that it is inside this inner for loop only that is using

05:36.710 --> 05:37.100
j.

05:37.130 --> 05:38.840
This is inside this loop only.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.590
I'll be continuing with one more time.

05:42.650 --> 05:44.780
Now J has became three.

05:44.780 --> 05:45.890
Now it will become four.

05:45.890 --> 05:50.480
So it will come out and take NL and it has gone on to outer loop again.

05:50.480 --> 05:57.080
I Now this time if I continue next now you can see that the value is two.

05:57.230 --> 05:59.960
Yes, J was four.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.360
Now again it will start from one onwards.

06:03.350 --> 06:06.950
Now you can see the value of J is one.

06:06.950 --> 06:07.790
Yes.

06:07.880 --> 06:14.060
Now it will display two comma one, two, comma, one and two comma two to comma three.

06:14.180 --> 06:17.150
Again, it has gone out and I became three now.

06:17.150 --> 06:19.520
So three, one, three, two, three, three.

06:20.120 --> 06:20.660
That's it.

06:20.660 --> 06:27.260
So this is how you can debug the program and check how the program is working.

06:27.260 --> 06:30.590
So this is very easy for understanding the program code.

06:35.150 --> 06:35.660
That's it.

06:35.660 --> 06:38.860
In the next video, we will see how to draw a few patterns.

06:38.870 --> 06:42.200
We will draw a few patterns using two for loops.

06:42.740 --> 06:46.520
I use the same code and modify it for showing patterns.
