00:00.740 --> 00:02.930
That us learn about pointer variable.

1
00:02.940 --> 00:10.660
See this is int type variable having value 10 and then also I will take a integer type pointer

2
00:10.910 --> 00:14.310
and to this I will assign address of A

3
00:28.310 --> 00:42.740
here I display value of A and endl then cout adress of A then cout.

4
00:43.070 --> 00:49.440
Just P, see  I have to get the pointer here and I have assigned the address of A to P.

5
00:49.460 --> 01:00.170
So if I display P I should get the address of A only then cout  address of P Also. as P is a  pointer

6
01:00.290 --> 01:02.000
is also occupying some space.

7
01:02.030 --> 01:11.920
I want to print its address then cout dereference P.

8
01:12.180 --> 01:14.280
Now I have some syntax here.

9
01:14.280 --> 01:20.170
I have declared a pointer and initialize a pointer and here I'm dereferencing a pointer.

10
01:20.370 --> 01:21.580
Let us run and see. what 

11
01:21.600 --> 01:27.720
All values I get.

12
01:28.110 --> 01:30.030
See first I am displaying a.

13
01:30.050 --> 01:31.950
So I got the value of A.

14
01:32.000 --> 01:34.470
That is the address of a.

15
01:34.490 --> 01:38.840
I got some hexa decimal a number ending with 4e8.

16
01:39.020 --> 01:43.510
Then what is P, P is a pointer which is storing address of a.

17
01:43.670 --> 01:46.360
So I got the same address.

18
01:46.610 --> 01:49.550
Then adress of P, P is a variable.

19
01:49.550 --> 01:51.320
It is also having its own adress.

20
01:51.410 --> 01:52.590
So this is  adress of P.

21
01:52.600 --> 01:53.270
P.

22
01:53.640 --> 01:59.520
Then here I am displaying the data of where P is  pointing So hereP is pointing on a.

23
01:59.570 --> 02:01.650
And A  contains 10.

24
02:01.670 --> 02:04.190
So here 10 is displayed.

25
02:04.940 --> 02:13.290
So this is the syntax for declaring and initializing a pointer and dereferencing a pointer.
