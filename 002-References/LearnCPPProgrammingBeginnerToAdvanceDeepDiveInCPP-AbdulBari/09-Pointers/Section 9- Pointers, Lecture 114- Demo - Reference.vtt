Let us look at a reference.

1
00:01.920 --> 00:06.680
Suppose I have a variable then for the same variable.

2
00:06.720 --> 00:12.220
I can also declare a reference that is a references  declared with & symbol.

3
00:12.540 --> 00:16.800
Now this Y is a reference to X..

4
00:16.810 --> 00:27.570
Now if I say Cout x value of x will be displayed then if I say Y plus plus the value of x will increment

5
00:27.910 --> 00:32.260
and even if I say X plus plus then the value of x is incremented.

6
00:32.340 --> 00:38.770
Now again if I say cout x here I mean incrementing value Y as well as value X..

7
00:38.820 --> 00:43.560
It means the same thing so the same value of x would be incremented twice and then I should get the answer

8
00:43.560 --> 00:45.080
as 12 here.

9
00:45.390 --> 00:49.480
So this X is incremented with a name Y.

10
00:49.690 --> 00:57.710
Let us run and see, see the first time the value of x is  10 and next the value of x is 12

11
00:57.720 --> 00:59.970
now let us see one more thing I will say.

12
00:59.970 --> 01:07.650
cout address of X and with some space I will display, address of y

13
01:10.450 --> 01:11.900
let's run this and see.

14
01:12.140 --> 01:17.950
So you can see that the address of variable x and y both are same.

15
01:17.980 --> 01:20.320
So Y is not another variable.

16
01:20.380 --> 01:26.620
It is just another name of same variable x so both are having same address.

17
01:26.620 --> 01:30.420
So it means Y is also the same thing so Y doesn't consume any memory.

18
01:30.610 --> 01:34.900
It's not declared just like a variable.

19
01:34.900 --> 01:41.080
Now one more thing I'm will show you see I cannot just declare a reference without initializing it.

20
01:41.340 --> 01:44.710
It's an error declaration of a reference variable y requires

21
01:44.800 --> 01:47.660
I got an error message and initializer.

22
01:47.710 --> 01:51.400
So a reference must be initialized whenever it is declared.

23
01:51.400 --> 02:00.400
So I must assign some variable name and even later on if I have supposed one more variable b with value

24
02:00.400 --> 02:00.970
20.

25
02:00.970 --> 02:06.540
Now I cannot say that this is y I want to assign it to B.

26
02:06.550 --> 02:12.150
I cannot do this so this will be actually storing the value of b in Y.

27
02:12.520 --> 02:16.690
Instead of changing a reference so I cannot say like this also.

28
02:17.060 --> 02:25.180
See I got message that expression is not assignable So that's how  one reference is created for some

29
02:25.180 --> 02:25.740
variable.

30
02:25.750 --> 02:27.350
It cannot be changed at all.

31
02:28.850 --> 02:31.000
So that's it, it's about reference.
