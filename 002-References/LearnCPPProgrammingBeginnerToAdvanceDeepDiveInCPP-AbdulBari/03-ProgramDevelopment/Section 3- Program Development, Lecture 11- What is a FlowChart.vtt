00:00.090 --> 00:07.740
in this Video let us talk about flow charts. flow charts where used at the time and monolithic programming

1
00:07.740 --> 00:15.330
was there than later on than when procedural programming came the usage of  flow charts was

2
00:15.350 --> 00:16.740
little redused.

3
00:16.910 --> 00:17.610
and today.

4
00:17.610 --> 00:23.930
We are following object oriented programming or aspect oriented programming so the usage of flowchart

5
00:23.970 --> 00:29.990
is very much less so what does a flow chart flow chart is used for showing the flow of control of a

6
00:29.990 --> 00:31.460
program.

7
00:31.550 --> 00:33.680
How the program is flowing.

8
00:33.770 --> 00:36.170
What are the steps it is performing.

9
00:36.170 --> 00:37.070
One by one.

10
00:38.120 --> 00:46.400
So if a program is very big it is hard to figure out how the flow of a program is so flow chart is useful

11
00:46.400 --> 00:49.280
for understanding the program, instead of 

12
00:49.280 --> 00:51.620
One is reading the program and understanding.

13
00:51.920 --> 00:56.360
He can see the flow chart and understand how the program is working.

14
00:56.360 --> 01:00.810
It is just like if you talk about electrical wiring in a home.

15
01:00.830 --> 01:05.270
Then from there the wires or the cables are moving through the walls.

16
01:05.270 --> 01:10.490
If you have a plan then you can know where exactly they are flowing and where are the important points.

17
01:10.490 --> 01:11.420
Everything you can know.

18
01:12.060 --> 01:16.040
Otherwise if there is any problem in the wiring then you have to dig the whole wall.

19
01:16.370 --> 01:18.350
You have to dig the whole wall to find out

20
01:18.350 --> 01:21.350
The problem is there is a proper plan.

21
01:21.350 --> 01:22.540
Then you can understand.

22
01:22.550 --> 01:26.860
So before laying the wire so pulling the wires we will make a plan.

23
01:26.870 --> 01:32.030
So same way before writing the program we make a flow chart right.

24
01:32.270 --> 01:34.160
So based on the flow chart we write the program.

25
01:34.160 --> 01:37.900
So this will help you understand the program.

26
01:38.220 --> 01:49.010
Now next usually when we are using flow chart the program as a scene as three steps: input, process and

27
01:49.160 --> 01:50.270
output.

28
01:50.270 --> 01:51.540
We call it like this.

29
01:51.540 --> 01:53.270
First it takes some input.

30
01:53.270 --> 01:55.100
Then it will process.

31
01:55.280 --> 01:58.670
Then it will give output.

32
01:59.330 --> 02:05.600
So any procedure you take it will have the similar steps like I was talking about a recipe preparing

33
02:05.600 --> 02:06.530
a dish.

34
02:06.530 --> 02:09.070
Input is the ingredients.

35
02:09.230 --> 02:12.770
That process is the process of making a dish and output.

36
02:12.980 --> 02:20.450
the dish is ready. if you take a chemistry experiment our chemistry experiment that is done usually in laboratories

37
02:20.990 --> 02:26.140
will have input means chemicals and the vessels or instruments for whatever you need.

38
02:26.240 --> 02:29.460
Then the process what you will do with that then it gets the desert.

39
02:29.920 --> 02:35.030
So every procedure will have these 3 things so program also used to see like this.

40
02:35.030 --> 02:36.660
Now for that program.

41
02:36.710 --> 02:41.350
We draw the flowchart Now let us look at the elements of the flow chart.

42
02:41.360 --> 02:43.220
This is a pictorial representation.

43
02:43.220 --> 02:45.700
So picture are there for representation.

44
02:45.830 --> 02:53.000
This ellipse is used for start and stop and this is for taking input as well as output.

45
02:53.270 --> 02:55.780
And this is for processing and this is condition.

46
02:55.820 --> 02:58.320
And this shows flow of control.

47
02:58.450 --> 03:04.160
Now draw a few flow charts and show you gives you the idea how flow charts are used and how they are

48
03:04.160 --> 03:10.630
useful for writing the programs. flow chart for adding two numbers.

49
03:10.640 --> 03:13.070
See first of all a flow chart starts.

50
03:13.070 --> 03:18.580
This is a start then for finding addition of two numbers.

51
03:18.590 --> 03:19.730
We need two numbers.

52
03:19.850 --> 03:21.380
So that is input.

53
03:21.380 --> 03:31.700
So we need input so we can give a message usually give the message that print Enter two numbers.

54
03:31.700 --> 03:36.290
So does a message usually we write that because we are writing a program program should be interactive.

55
03:36.290 --> 03:37.790
So for that purpose right.

56
03:37.970 --> 03:39.910
Then read 2 numbers.

57
03:39.910 --> 03:41.390
So we read them in variables.

58
03:41.600 --> 03:43.770
A and B.

59
03:44.010 --> 03:44.880
This is input.

60
03:44.880 --> 03:51.990
Now we have two numbers and variables and b then next step is process so processing that we have to

61
03:51.990 --> 03:52.350
do.

62
03:52.500 --> 03:59.070
We have to add a and b and stored the result in C this is processing.

63
03:59.070 --> 04:05.910
We have the result in c now so output, display the output so print sum as

64
04:09.410 --> 04:13.220
c that's all end of the procedure.

65
04:13.250 --> 04:14.160
that is a stop.

66
04:15.080 --> 04:16.420
So does that end a flowchart.

67
04:17.270 --> 04:21.920
So how it's going to work first it in input then it will perform addition then it'll give the output

68
04:22.340 --> 04:23.660
then it will stop.

69
04:23.660 --> 04:25.910
So this shows the flow of control.

70
04:25.910 --> 04:27.860
These lines are showing the flow right.

71
04:27.860 --> 04:31.970
These lines are showing flow there's a simple example.

72
04:32.100 --> 04:37.440
The next example I will draw a flow chart for finding a greater number.

73
04:37.560 --> 04:41.100
If you have two numbers then which one is the greater we will find out.

74
04:41.400 --> 04:44.810
So in that till here it will be same  we need to take two numbers.

75
04:44.940 --> 04:47.680
Then from a and b you'll find out which one is greater.

76
04:47.700 --> 04:48.910
Whichever one is greater.

77
04:49.050 --> 04:57.410
We will print that greater number so I'll remove this and modify this one so here flowchart starts and

78
04:57.670 --> 04:58.930
it will take two numbers.

79
04:58.940 --> 05:01.190
Now we don't know which number is greater.

80
05:01.190 --> 05:06.590
So then we have to check with the condition that if a is greater than B The A is greater.

81
05:07.160 --> 05:11.090
Otherwise B is greater so for a condition we can use this symbol.

82
05:11.090 --> 05:14.780
So here I will draw condition box.

83
05:14.780 --> 05:20.570
So here I can check if A is greater than B if it is a true.

84
05:20.600 --> 05:24.550
Then we will print A if it is a false and then we will print B.

85
05:24.560 --> 05:26.880
Now here there are two branches.

86
05:27.020 --> 05:28.490
True or false.

87
05:28.490 --> 05:30.830
So I will take two branches first one.

88
05:30.830 --> 05:33.270
Let us take it as true, if this is true.

89
05:33.860 --> 05:36.010
And second one if it is false.

90
05:36.110 --> 05:48.470
So if it is true then we will print a value a print a simply I will say A then here false print.

91
05:48.490 --> 05:53.020
B if it is not then print B then what to do after this.

92
05:53.030 --> 05:54.380
That's all it is over.

93
05:54.410 --> 05:55.700
So this is over.

94
05:55.700 --> 05:57.800
Then finally it has to stop.

95
05:58.030 --> 05:58.280
Right.

96
05:58.610 --> 06:04.430
So this will flow and come here and this will join at this point.

97
06:04.430 --> 06:06.110
So this will also stop.

98
06:07.100 --> 06:13.690
So this all we can use a condition box if a is greater than B true then print a false means.

99
06:13.700 --> 06:14.460
B is greater.

100
06:14.480 --> 06:16.810
So print B so we can look at this one.

101
06:16.880 --> 06:22.460
Now we will see one more flowchart for printing numbers from 1 to 10.

102
06:22.780 --> 06:29.750
So I will remove this and draw flowchart for printing numbers from 

103
06:29.750 --> 06:31.440
from 1 to 10.

104
06:31.940 --> 06:36.430
So for printing we have to do two things one is print.

105
06:36.530 --> 06:45.440
Second is count like 1 print, 2 print and 3 print so counting as well as printing two things we have to do so keep

106
06:45.440 --> 06:45.970
in mind.

107
06:46.060 --> 06:51.580
i will draw it let us start this as a starting point of a flow chart.

108
06:51.600 --> 06:53.990
Now next we have to take any input.

109
06:53.990 --> 06:54.370
No.

110
06:54.410 --> 06:57.050
We already know what we have to print numbers from 1 to10.

111
06:57.140 --> 07:03.890
So there is no input than initially we should have some counter for counting as we are printing

112
07:03.890 --> 07:04.600
from one onwards.

113
07:04.600 --> 07:06.710
So we need something starting from 1 onwards.

114
07:06.710 --> 07:08.390
So for that we take a counter.

115
07:08.420 --> 07:12.020
So this is a process so in processing we will take i.

116
07:12.050 --> 07:14.860
That is initially it is one for first time.

117
07:14.870 --> 07:18.560
it will be 1 so we will be printing it right now.

118
07:18.650 --> 07:20.860
Next we will print this one.

119
07:20.870 --> 07:29.300
So print means output so print i, so first time it will be printing one next.

120
07:29.360 --> 07:32.500
After this I should change it to 2.

121
07:32.510 --> 07:35.130
If it is one then it should increase by 1.

122
07:35.150 --> 07:36.680
So how to increase it by 1.

123
07:36.980 --> 07:38.540
So this is again a process.

124
07:38.540 --> 07:40.240
It is not input output.

125
07:40.370 --> 07:45.470
So whatever I value is in that add 1and store the result in i

126
07:45.710 --> 07:52.460
So this will increase the value of i by one in the next I have to print again.

127
07:52.550 --> 07:57.770
So again print and again increase again print and again increase how long.

128
07:58.250 --> 08:02.240
As long as I is less than or equal to 10.

129
08:03.050 --> 08:06.970
So is I equal to 10 now or is it less then.

130
08:07.100 --> 08:09.290
Yes it is less than, so how to  check.

131
08:10.760 --> 08:12.470
Checking condition box.

132
08:12.470 --> 08:15.790
So here again we need a condition box.

133
08:15.890 --> 08:21.930
So here inside this condition what we will check if i is less than or equal to 10.

134
08:22.280 --> 08:25.940
If yes we will print the again and increment.

135
08:25.940 --> 08:31.660
So if yes that is true, if this true then go here again start.

136
08:32.150 --> 08:34.040
So this is like a loop.

137
08:34.220 --> 08:39.830
This like a loop it will go there and again start and go there again stop how long it will be go on

138
08:39.830 --> 08:43.340
repeating as long as this is true how long that is true.

139
08:43.340 --> 08:50.840
If I is less than or equal to 10 so when I becomes eleven we should not print so false if it is a false

140
08:50.920 --> 08:51.470
means.

141
08:51.650 --> 09:02.290
This is false we should stop ,this  is stop so that's all the flowchart for printing numbers from

142
09:02.680 --> 09:04.430
1 to 10.

143
09:04.750 --> 09:10.030
This is how flow charts values in early days of programming but still in academic.

144
09:10.030 --> 09:15.620
So this is being used this is being taught initially but it is not much useful later on.

145
09:15.850 --> 09:20.230
But initially for understanding programming this is little helpful.

146
09:21.160 --> 09:28.750
So that's all about the flowchart and next video we will see what are the steps involved for writing and

147
09:28.750 --> 09:30.760
compiling and executing a program.

148
09:30.790 --> 09:33.970
So step four development and execution of a program.
