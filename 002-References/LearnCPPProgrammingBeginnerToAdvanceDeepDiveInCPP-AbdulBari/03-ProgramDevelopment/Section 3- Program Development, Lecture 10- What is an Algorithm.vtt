00:00.320 --> 00:07.080
In this video i will discuss about algorithm, pseudocode and program.

1
00:07.080 --> 00:08.460
Let us learn more about him.

2
00:08.790 --> 00:10.820
First of all algorithm.

3
00:10.830 --> 00:12.900
What is this.

4
00:12.900 --> 00:21.510
By definition algorithm is a step by step procedure for solving a computational problem.

5
00:22.560 --> 00:23.920
Then what is the program.

6
00:24.240 --> 00:31.890
Program is also same a step step by step machine instructional program instruction for solving any problem

7
00:31.920 --> 00:37.230
that is computational task then what is the difference between algorithm and program.

8
00:37.240 --> 00:46.120
See we have started writing programming recently but algorithms are existing from centuries. people have

9
00:46.120 --> 00:51.190
been devising procedures for solving computational problem.

10
00:51.280 --> 00:56.290
This is common practice who are doing this mostly mathematicians where doing it or scientists are

11
00:56.290 --> 00:57.100
doing it.

12
00:57.100 --> 01:02.650
So those who are working on some problems studying a problem and finding a solution, they were giving

13
01:02.650 --> 01:04.670
a solution in the form of algorithm .

14
01:04.720 --> 01:07.870
That is procedure step by step procedure.

15
01:07.870 --> 01:12.740
Now we want that same procedure should be followed our machines.

16
01:12.760 --> 01:14.050
So we are writing program.

17
01:14.410 --> 01:14.770
OK.

18
01:14.810 --> 01:15.550
Yes that's it.

19
01:15.820 --> 01:19.460
So it means first we have algorithm right.

20
01:19.480 --> 01:24.390
First we have algorithm then we convert that into program.

21
01:24.420 --> 01:27.840
Yes exactly exactly.

22
01:27.880 --> 01:34.800
Then as a student if you will study what do you learn here? you learn how to solve a problem.

23
01:34.810 --> 01:39.200
This is different how to solve a problem right.

24
01:39.250 --> 01:42.060
So are you capable of solving any problem.

25
01:42.070 --> 01:44.400
It's not easy to start solving problems.

26
01:44.440 --> 01:50.270
First of all you learn few procedures then from that you get some new idea.

27
01:50.380 --> 01:53.600
Then you can start solving the problem by yourself.

28
01:53.650 --> 01:59.920
You need some skills you have to develop some skills analytical skills or problem solving skills you

29
01:59.920 --> 02:04.850
have to get it so that mostly you get from various other subjects as well as mathematics, its not purely 

30
02:04.870 --> 02:09.650
completely mathematics various other subjects and it depends on your IQ level also.

31
02:10.140 --> 02:11.500
How do you solve a problem.

32
02:11.500 --> 02:16.040
So if you know how to solve a problem you can write it as a algorithm.

33
02:16.240 --> 02:20.800
It is just like if you know how to prepare the dish.

34
02:20.800 --> 02:25.200
If you are a chef then you will prepare recipe right.

35
02:25.220 --> 02:31.520
If you are a chemist then you will prepare a chemical formula and you will prepare an experiment for

36
02:32.150 --> 02:33.190
chemical formula.

37
02:33.200 --> 02:35.410
Getting the chemical result right.

38
02:35.780 --> 02:42.380
If you are a musician you will compose music so if you are a mathematician you will write an algorithm

39
02:42.680 --> 02:45.890
that is procedure that's it.

40
02:45.910 --> 02:48.810
So this requires different skills right.

41
02:48.850 --> 02:53.760
So mainly awareness of your mathematics and awareness of problem solving.

42
02:53.860 --> 03:00.340
If you have an algorithm then we want our machine to perform that algorithm and get the result, write 

43
03:00.360 --> 03:01.800
it in the form of a program.

44
03:01.870 --> 03:04.620
So converting an algorithm into a program.

45
03:04.980 --> 03:07.400
So that's what you should know the language.

46
03:07.420 --> 03:11.770
So if you know the programming language then you can pick up that programming language and write on

47
03:11.770 --> 03:12.490
a program.

48
03:12.550 --> 03:16.200
Convert this into this then, how do you write in which language you write this one?

49
03:16.200 --> 03:19.370
we can use any language here.

50
03:19.420 --> 03:21.780
English like language or directly English also

51
03:21.820 --> 03:28.780
English also you can use here, but people use some formal notation it looks more like mathematical or

52
03:28.780 --> 03:34.920
more like programming like so that type of code we call it pseudo code. right.

53
03:34.930 --> 03:39.170
So pseudocode is not defined not a standard whatever you write is pseudo code.

54
03:40.170 --> 03:40.900
Right.

55
03:41.010 --> 03:46.960
Sometimes we define our team will define and follow that one otherwise if it is understandable that's

56
03:46.960 --> 03:52.600
enough you write any way you like but program you must strictly follow.

57
03:52.600 --> 04:02.300
If you're using C++ then you should strictly follow Syntax, means Grammar of that particular language here.

58
04:02.340 --> 04:08.080
There is no grammar as long as one can understand if a person can read at least if you are  write

59
04:08.080 --> 04:09.240
you should understand it.

60
04:09.340 --> 04:11.250
That's enough. that is a pseudocode.

61
04:12.310 --> 04:17.960
So analysts or mathematicians who know how to solve a problem will write algorithm and programmer will write 

62
04:18.000 --> 04:19.420
on a program.

63
04:19.420 --> 04:25.900
So now as a student as a computer science student or person you have to devise an algorithm and you

64
04:25.900 --> 04:26.860
have to write a program.

65
04:27.580 --> 04:33.010
But so many algorithms are already available we struggle learning about them only that is sufficient

66
04:33.300 --> 04:38.080
if you know aboard all existing algorithms and you know how to convert them into program that is

67
04:38.080 --> 04:38.650
sufficient.

68
04:38.650 --> 04:42.840
You don't have to invent anything new unless and until you need it.

69
04:42.850 --> 04:44.570
And if it is not existing.

70
04:45.160 --> 04:45.460
Right.

71
04:45.700 --> 04:46.850
So this is the general idea.

72
04:46.870 --> 04:52.180
about the algorithm watch this program and also pseudo code I gave you for learning programming.

73
04:52.180 --> 04:56.830
People will first the right algorithm then they will convert it into a program so that if you have

74
04:56.830 --> 05:01.630
a practice of this one and then later on you have to devise your own algorithm you should

75
05:01.630 --> 05:02.840
be able to do it.

76
05:02.890 --> 05:05.850
You should not be new to algorithms.

77
05:05.880 --> 05:10.140
Now let me write an example algorithm and also for that I will write on a C++ program.

78
05:10.290 --> 05:15.920
But I'm not going to explain you how that program is written and all just a sample to look at.

79
05:16.540 --> 05:17.170
Let me write down it.

80
05:17.560 --> 05:24.010
So here I have an example algorithm as well as a program that the C++ program that is not a complete

81
05:24.010 --> 05:25.690
program just a function.

82
05:25.690 --> 05:27.110
Let us study this.

83
05:27.300 --> 05:33.100
See this is for finding average of list of elements I have collection of elements I want to find out

84
05:33.170 --> 05:34.100
average.

85
05:34.550 --> 05:36.600
Read it sum is 0.

86
05:36.690 --> 05:38.610
OK sum assign zero.

87
05:38.620 --> 05:41.260
This means put this zero inside sum.

88
05:41.650 --> 05:49.030
Yes that is the meaning the arrow is showing the direction then for each element x in list so we will call

89
05:49.030 --> 05:54.030
each element as X in the list then begin sum assigned sum+ x.

90
05:54.040 --> 06:00.080
So go on adding the element in sum so this portion as adding all the elements.

91
06:00.100 --> 06:06.520
Then after that average assigned sum by a number of elements though I get an average number then, return average

92
06:07.500 --> 06:12.480
so if you read you can understand for finding the average of a list of elements.

93
06:12.530 --> 06:14.940
Add all of them and divide by number of elements.

94
06:15.820 --> 06:20.650
that's it. how this is written as English not exactly English.

95
06:21.070 --> 06:23.880
Similar English as it does C C++ program.

96
06:23.890 --> 06:26.340
If you have ever seen it is it looking like that.

97
06:26.370 --> 06:28.330
No but is it readable.

98
06:28.330 --> 06:28.920
Yes.

99
06:28.920 --> 06:30.990
Then what is this code? pseudo pseudocode.

100
06:31.380 --> 06:32.220
It's a pseudo code.

101
06:33.490 --> 06:36.730
So let us make some changes, if i stop writing this.

102
06:36.760 --> 06:38.830
Can I say colon.

103
06:38.870 --> 06:44.260
assign, equal to, colon equal to. this is also showing a direction.

104
06:44.270 --> 06:46.850
Then here also colon equal too.

105
06:46.890 --> 06:54.410
Yes you can write, you can write, you can read write, so if you want to change the symbol change the symbol

106
06:55.750 --> 06:59.610
alright for each element x in list.

107
06:59.750 --> 07:03.330
do mostly we find like this.

108
07:03.370 --> 07:04.070
Okay you add it.

109
07:04.110 --> 07:05.100
That's also meaningful.

110
07:05.700 --> 07:07.440
So instead  of begin and end.

111
07:07.670 --> 07:12.790
I will say flower bracket yes.

112
07:12.820 --> 07:14.690
That is also showing the beginning and ending.

113
07:14.770 --> 07:16.350
No I believe was a square bracket.

114
07:16.510 --> 07:16.920
OK.

115
07:16.930 --> 07:17.470
Use it.

116
07:17.890 --> 07:20.010
So now this is sufficient.

117
07:20.020 --> 07:23.270
The idea is whatever you write it should be relevant.

118
07:24.680 --> 07:25.360
Right.

119
07:25.390 --> 07:26.280
It should not.

120
07:26.290 --> 07:29.850
One should not get confused at least for whom you are writing.

121
07:29.850 --> 07:31.920
This should not get confused.

122
07:31.920 --> 07:36.040
This is how we write or algorithm using pseudocode.

123
07:36.070 --> 07:42.370
Now the same thing for finding average of list of elements, this is C++ program.

124
07:42.370 --> 07:47.460
It's a function it's not a complete program just a function inside this.

125
07:47.710 --> 07:56.080
If I don't get semicolon it's an error, an intead of assignment if I write less than an hyphen it's

126
07:56.080 --> 07:59.100
wrong compilers say what is this.

127
07:59.350 --> 08:01.690
If you want to store the value here like this.

128
08:01.690 --> 08:07.030
If you want to store the value you must use equal to symbol and that is called an assignment.

129
08:07.090 --> 08:11.240
You must write like this,where ever  if you write semicolon.

130
08:11.260 --> 08:12.430
It will not work.

131
08:12.670 --> 08:16.460
So it means you should follow the proper syntax of a language.

132
08:16.470 --> 08:19.540
Because this is not for you .

133
08:19.540 --> 08:25.000
You are writing it for the compiler to understand it and convert it into machine code, so you will write

134
08:25.000 --> 08:29.810
C++ program and that gets converted into machine code or machine language.

135
08:29.920 --> 08:32.500
Who converts that compiler will convert.

136
08:32.510 --> 08:35.360
So you are talking to compiler actually.

137
08:35.530 --> 08:40.900
So you should talk such a way easily understand if it is not understanding it cannot convert it

138
08:40.900 --> 08:41.960
into a machine code.

139
08:42.940 --> 08:45.490
So this language is the language of compiler.

140
08:45.760 --> 08:48.280
So you should follow the syntax perfectly.

141
08:48.340 --> 08:53.760
That is the reason you have to put some little extra efforts for learning programming initially you will do

142
08:53.770 --> 08:54.390
mistakes.

143
08:54.400 --> 08:59.770
You will not write the things properly you miss few things you know not know what errors you get.

144
08:59.770 --> 09:02.520
Once you start getting errors we will start realizing okay.

145
09:02.530 --> 09:08.910
These are the mistakes I'm doing so from mistakes you will learn programming so that's all about the

146
09:09.090 --> 09:12.420
comparisons of algorithms, pseudo code and program.

147
09:13.140 --> 09:16.980
So I have given you enough basics so that all in this video.

148
09:17.460 --> 09:19.290
So the next topic is flowchart.
