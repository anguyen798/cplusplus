let's Write a program to take two numbers for dividing them and before division let us check whether their

1
00:06.760 --> 00:08.040
denominator is zero.

2
00:08.340 --> 00:21.060
So integer A B and C i will take three variables then out enter two numbers then cin i will read A and B

3
00:21.060 --> 00:25.920
and I want to divide A and B and store the result in C.

4
00:26.340 --> 00:34.620
But before dividing I want to know whether B is valid denominator or not meant if B is zero then division

5
00:34.620 --> 00:35.800
cannot be done.

6
00:35.850 --> 00:40.940
So if  B is equal to zero, I will give a message that cout

7
00:46.340 --> 00:54.600
division by zero means if I continue further the value will be get divided by 0.

8
00:54.620 --> 01:04.450
So I will not divide the number else if it is a valid denominator.

9
01:04.470 --> 01:06.070
So it is not a zero.

10
01:06.230 --> 01:13.520
Then we will divide and display the result that is cout c and endl

11
01:17.300 --> 01:20.690
is a type of validation again before dividing two numbers.

12
01:20.690 --> 01:24.480
We are verifying that the denominator is non-zero.

13
01:24.530 --> 01:27.280
If it is 0 we will say division by zero.

14
01:27.850 --> 01:28.960
Let us run and see

15
01:31.890 --> 01:32.670
enter two numbers.

16
01:32.680 --> 01:34.300
I have entered so the first number

17
01:34.300 --> 01:36.890
I will enter 10 and the second number is zero.

18
01:37.240 --> 01:41.070
See the error message that I got is division by zero.

19
01:41.380 --> 01:43.370
This is a division by zero.

20
01:44.050 --> 01:45.300
I run once again

21
01:48.200 --> 01:52.170
enter the two numbers, so I will give the first number as a 10 and the second number as two.

22
01:52.310 --> 01:56.210
So I got the answer that is 5.

23
01:56.210 --> 02:02.140
This is 5, so you can try this program by yourself.
