00:00.930 --> 00:06.580
Let us write  a program to take a day number and display name. variablei will take and

1
00:06.600 --> 00:17.540
And here I will say cout enter day number than cin day.

2
00:17.730 --> 00:19.660
I'm reading the volume in this video.

3
00:20.310 --> 00:26.230
Now if day no. is one I will say Monday or two tuesday so on.

4
00:26.250 --> 00:26.960
So let us write.

5
00:27.000 --> 00:36.500
If day is equals to 1 then cout Monday

6
00:39.000 --> 00:44.410
and endl. else now again i have to write down the condition.

7
00:44.400 --> 00:48.200
So what I did do is,  i will copied and past it here.

8
00:55.860 --> 01:00.540
This is for second day that is tuesday.

9
01:01.500 --> 01:03.100
I'll copy this entire thing

10
01:10.100 --> 01:11.210
I'll paste here.

11
01:11.320 --> 01:13.210
This is for Wednesday

12
01:15.930 --> 01:19.080
third day then it is wednesday

13
01:23.480 --> 01:28.210
fourth day that is Thursday.

14
01:31.680 --> 01:35.790
Fifth day is Friday.

15
01:38.700 --> 01:42.820
6th is Saturday.

16
01:43.740 --> 01:44.700
And finally

17
01:47.520 --> 01:49.620
7 day is Sunday

18
01:54.720 --> 02:02.760
else cout  invalid day number.

19
02:03.020 --> 02:11.140
So here is a code for taking a day number and displaying day name.

20
02:11.220 --> 02:12.530
Let me run this program

21
02:17.890 --> 02:20.480
enter day number, i will say day is 4.

22
02:20.650 --> 02:22.790
So I go there as it does Thursday.

23
02:23.350 --> 02:32.700
I'll run it again enter day number so I will enter day as 7.

24
02:32.920 --> 02:35.080
So I got Sunday.

25
02:35.080 --> 02:42.140
Here it is Sunday now run it again. enter day number as 10.

26
02:42.310 --> 02:45.740
So I got a message that is invalid day.

27
02:46.300 --> 02:48.140
It's working.

28
02:48.170 --> 02:53.710
Now one interesting thing I will show you I'll put a breakpoint on line 9 so that it will run to line

29
02:53.710 --> 02:58.660
number 8 then it will start debugging from line 9.

30
02:58.660 --> 03:02.660
So I'll put the breakpoint run.

31
03:03.280 --> 03:05.470
Now here it is asking day number.

32
03:05.470 --> 03:07.240
I'll give the day no. as 7.

33
03:07.240 --> 03:09.190
That is for Sunday.

34
03:09.220 --> 03:18.910
Let us check what happens. see it has stop at line number 9 where day is one, now  if I press F 7 then it will

35
03:18.910 --> 03:19.680
jump onto 

36
03:19.750 --> 03:28.090
If-else see it has came to this line and checking whether day is it two then checking day 3

37
03:28.090 --> 03:33.430
line then f7 it is checking here in this line.

38
03:33.430 --> 03:38.220
That is the day 4 goes on to checking all the conditions.

39
03:38.230 --> 03:46.560
Then next is the 5 and 6 then 7 Sunday, then it comes out.

40
03:46.600 --> 03:50.130
See it has to check all the conditions to reach a 7.

41
03:50.320 --> 03:57.430
So this code is little time consuming because for reaching 7 day it has to check all days from 1 to

42
03:57.430 --> 04:00.610
7.

43
04:00.610 --> 04:02.110
This type of code is called as

44
04:02.110 --> 04:08.650
else-if ladder, now instead of using else if ladder we have a better syntax in C++ that is switch case

45
04:08.690 --> 04:14.310
we can go for switch case so you can try this program by yourself.

46
04:14.320 --> 04:17.660
Type the program and run and see.

47
04:17.740 --> 04:19.900
I suggest you to make use of debugger.
