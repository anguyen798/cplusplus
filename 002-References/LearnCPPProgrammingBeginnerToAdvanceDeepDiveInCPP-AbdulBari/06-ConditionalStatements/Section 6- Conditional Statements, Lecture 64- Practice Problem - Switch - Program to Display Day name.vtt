00:00.840 --> 00:09.600
let us write a program using switch case for taking a day number and displaying day name let us say 1is

1
00:09.600 --> 00:15.530
Monday, two is Tuesday and so on I will declare a variable  day.

2
00:15.570 --> 00:17.430
And I will say cout,

3
00:18.180 --> 00:34.170
enter day number and cin read the value of Day from keyboard then switch up on Day. then, case one, if it is

4
00:34.170 --> 00:46.260
one then say cout Monday and slash n For new line and then break.

5
00:46.580 --> 00:59.450
Case two cout tuesday and slash n for a new line then break statement case 3.

6
00:59.460 --> 01:02.530
Same here I will write on all cout

7
01:22.540 --> 01:24.040
defaulted cout

8
01:27.040 --> 01:28.920
invalidly Day.

9
01:29.140 --> 01:31.150
That's it.

10
01:31.150 --> 01:35.360
Now I have written for all the cases and also I have included default.

11
01:35.380 --> 01:41.880
Let us run this program. so i have written for all the cases

12
01:44.620 --> 01:46.850
So i have written for all the cases.

13
01:46.890 --> 01:49.400
And also I have written default here.

14
01:49.620 --> 01:51.600
Now let us run the program and see

15
01:55.700 --> 01:56.790
I'll give the number.

16
01:56.780 --> 02:01.920
Here I have to entera no. I have  given the number one.

17
02:02.460 --> 02:08.640
Here i  have to give Day no. but I'll give the numbers as one then it is coming as Monday.

18
02:08.640 --> 02:12.420
run once again and give the number 7.

19
02:12.430 --> 02:15.320
So it is Sunday.

20
02:15.320 --> 02:19.280
One more time, 10 it is invalid.

21
02:19.390 --> 02:26.800
day. so like this you can take some month number and display month names also.

22
02:27.240 --> 02:30.050
So you have tried all possible cases for that 12 months.

23
02:30.050 --> 02:33.930
You have write down and also if you want default you can get a default also.

24
02:34.160 --> 02:41.510
And one more interesting thing you can do is you can take one digit on the display digit in words like

25
02:41.990 --> 02:45.120
1 meane one, 2 means two

26
02:45.170 --> 02:49.510
And so on for all 10 digits from zero to 9.

27
02:49.700 --> 02:51.200
You can write on cases.

28
02:54.660 --> 02:59.340
and one more interesting thing I have to show you that in between case and the case number there must

29
02:59.340 --> 03:01.700
be a space without space.

30
03:01.740 --> 03:08.310
It will be a invalid case so the compiler will not give any error message but it is giving him warning

31
03:08.310 --> 03:11.090
that code will never be executed.

32
03:11.340 --> 03:18.380
So there is no case 1 now Case 2 and 3 and 4 we have on this label is not our case.

33
03:18.420 --> 03:24.210
It will be taken as a label so it is giving a warning that will never be executed.

34
03:24.480 --> 03:31.150
So give proper spacing between case and the case number so you can try other programs.
