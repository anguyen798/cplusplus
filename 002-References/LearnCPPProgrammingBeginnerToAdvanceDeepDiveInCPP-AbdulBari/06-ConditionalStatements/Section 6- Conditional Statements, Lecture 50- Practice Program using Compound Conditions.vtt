00:00.190 --> 00:06.480
So we have already written a program using compound conditional statements let us look at some more

1
00:06.480 --> 00:10.270
example programs by using compound conditional statement.

2
00:10.950 --> 00:16.420
So here in this video I will take one example and I will show you how to use AND

3
00:16.470 --> 00:18.040
I will show you how to use OR.

4
00:18.750 --> 00:20.290
So let us take an example.

5
00:20.550 --> 00:25.710
Suppose I wanted to take the age of a person and find out whether he is young or not.

6
00:26.580 --> 00:27.930
Suppose I'm the program.

7
00:28.050 --> 00:30.670
Then what is the input I should know your age.

8
00:30.780 --> 00:33.080
Then looking at an age I should say that you are young.

9
00:33.630 --> 00:36.690
So what is the condition, what age is a young age.

10
00:36.690 --> 00:44.630
So let's say age from 12 starts at young age and last age 50.

11
00:44.640 --> 00:48.720
So before 12 he is a child of more than 50.

12
00:48.750 --> 00:50.550
Let's say he's an old person.

13
00:50.550 --> 00:51.450
Let us take this one.

14
00:51.450 --> 00:53.860
So if you want to change its values you can change it.

15
00:53.880 --> 01:00.960
I'm taking the example like this so I should check take your age and check that it should be greater than

16
01:00.960 --> 01:01.550
equal to 12,

17
01:01.590 --> 01:04.290
and less than equal to 50.

18
01:04.410 --> 01:06.040
So there are two values I have to check.

19
01:06.060 --> 01:07.630
So how to frame the condition.

20
01:07.710 --> 01:14.360
See if age is a variable then it should be greater than or equal to 12 so greater than equal to 12

21
01:14.360 --> 01:14.840
means

22
01:14.830 --> 01:21.870
So if I draw a line for first year to 100 years of age it is 12 years here,

23
01:21.870 --> 01:23.530
lets say its 12 years here,

24
01:23.670 --> 01:25.040
So it's going in this direction.

25
01:25.050 --> 01:25.320
Right.

26
01:25.650 --> 01:27.270
And it should stop at 50.

27
01:27.540 --> 01:28.740
So let us say 50 year is here.

28
01:28.800 --> 01:30.410
So it should stop at 50.

29
01:30.480 --> 01:33.860
So it should be greater then 12 and less than 50.

30
01:33.870 --> 01:43.070
So here I will write in English that is AND age should be less than 50 or equal to 50.

31
01:43.110 --> 01:47.080
So here we use AND, and both the time we have to say age.

32
01:47.140 --> 01:50.190
So this is one condition and this is second condition.

33
01:50.310 --> 01:55.610
We are joining these two condition using AND so first condition age is greater than equal to zero.

34
01:55.890 --> 02:00.770
And second condition that is age is less than equal to 50 and that are join with

35
02:00.790 --> 02:06.160
AND. so one idea i will give you here when you are looking for the value that should be within this

36
02:06.180 --> 02:11.300
range that is starting from this point and ending at here then it should be between these two means

37
02:11.310 --> 02:12.540
you have to use and.

38
02:13.510 --> 02:14.220
Right.

39
02:14.460 --> 02:20.730
So here already I have a flowchart let us write a program for that first let us look at the flow check

40
02:21.400 --> 02:27.480
as a program I should take input from you the input here is age so here input box enter age and read

41
02:27.570 --> 02:30.450
then I should check what is the age.

42
02:30.450 --> 02:41.130
So here I will write on the condition if age is greater than or equal to twelve and age is less than

43
02:41.130 --> 02:42.490
or equal to 50.

44
02:43.060 --> 02:51.830
If this is a true then print young otherwise false then not young, print not young and stop. so this is the flowchart

45
02:52.400 --> 02:53.790
not looking at the flow chart.

46
02:53.790 --> 02:54.870
I will write down the program.

47
02:55.190 --> 02:58.370
So let us write the program and see I'm not showing you the algorithm.

48
02:58.410 --> 02:58.970
now you can write down the algorithm,

49
02:58.970 --> 03:03.150
I have shown you a few algorithms you can follow the same procedure and write down the

50
03:03.150 --> 03:04.570
algorithms if at all.

51
03:04.740 --> 03:10.370
It requires in your academic. now I guess you are in a position to write algorithms by yourself.

52
03:10.460 --> 03:15.570
There is nothing but a simple language is used for writing a program right now let us write a program.

53
03:15.590 --> 03:20.550
now for program I'm not writing hash include all those things so it's understood it's there right

54
03:21.180 --> 03:23.020
now let us convert this.

55
03:23.100 --> 03:25.930
So what does the first thing enter age .

56
03:25.980 --> 03:31.260
So it means there is only one variable that is required in this program that is age so I should declare

57
03:31.650 --> 03:38.730
age is which type? Integer type, we will not take twelve point five years or twelve

58
03:38.730 --> 03:41.220
point seven five years, 12 year or next 13 years.

59
03:41.250 --> 03:47.630
So let us take it as integer then here I should give a Cout enter age

60
03:51.390 --> 04:00.690
then cin I should read age value ok, now that condition but how right on the same condition in c++

61
04:01.140 --> 04:09.530
if age is greater than equal to 12 AND means we have this && symbol then age is less than or equal to

62
04:09.580 --> 04:15.150
fifty then here I should print the message cout young

63
04:18.510 --> 04:29.670
then else cout not young, see here I have not use of flower brackets I'm not using these flower brackets

64
04:30.000 --> 04:35.640
so if you have a single line in the inside if and single line inside else no need of Flower brackets

65
04:35.730 --> 04:40.890
otherwise writing flower bracket is a good practice if you don't have more than one statement just

66
04:40.890 --> 04:43.110
you have one statement you can skip it.

67
04:43.290 --> 04:49.440
So with out flower bracket also you can write and at the end I should write down return zero.

68
04:49.440 --> 04:52.050
a common practice in a main function you should write.

69
04:52.080 --> 04:57.930
So this is the program so you can type the program and test it, demo is  also given for it and in the

70
04:57.930 --> 05:02.480
coding exercise I would be asking you just write down the condition instead of writing a complete program

71
05:02.870 --> 05:08.150
just write down the conditions, coding exercise condition part will be left blank so you have to practice

72
05:08.150 --> 05:14.750
the condition so just with that you can learn how to write down the conditions let us write one more program

73
05:15.440 --> 05:25.550
same example but here let us say we want to know the person this child or old  he should not be young.

74
05:25.610 --> 05:29.220
suppose, Example there is some offer going on for children or aged people.

75
05:29.320 --> 05:29.570
Right.

76
05:29.900 --> 05:33.630
So let us say offer is for children or aged people not for young people.

77
05:33.680 --> 05:41.330
So whether he is eligible for that offer or not let us write a condition learn how to write down the

78
05:41.330 --> 05:47.060
condition for that then I will write on the program so flowchart will be same only just I have to

79
05:47.060 --> 05:52.520
change the messages that is eligible or not eligible so I'll make changes here and then we will discuss

80
05:52.520 --> 06:00.230
the next question. so let us frame a condition here, see to be eligible for an offer he should be

81
06:00.230 --> 06:03.020
a child or old person but not young people.

82
06:03.650 --> 06:10.580
So you have already taken this one that up to two years it is a child from 12 to 50 it is

83
06:11.000 --> 06:15.260
young and beyond this it's old age.

84
06:15.470 --> 06:23.240
Now in this one we have to see that the age should fall on the side to be a child or on that side to

85
06:23.240 --> 06:25.220
be a older person.

86
06:25.250 --> 06:27.560
So for these people offer is not there.

87
06:27.650 --> 06:36.290
So we have to check that age is on this side if true is a child otherwise age should be on this

88
06:36.290 --> 06:41.380
side otherwise means or, so age should be greater than 50.

89
06:41.420 --> 06:46.730
So in this we are not looking for the value within the range we are looking for the value that is on

90
06:46.790 --> 06:48.780
different sites off range.

91
06:48.830 --> 06:51.520
So now OR operator is useful.

92
06:52.310 --> 06:57.410
So let us frame the conditions already I have a flowchart here and I made a message that is eligible

93
06:57.410 --> 07:00.130
and not eligible just i will write down the condition here.

94
07:00.170 --> 07:09.540
So the condition is if age is less than 12 years, so equal to 12 years onwards we are saying he is young

95
07:09.540 --> 07:10.030
young.

96
07:10.930 --> 07:12.650
OR

97
07:13.820 --> 07:18.940
Age is greater than 50.

98
07:19.220 --> 07:23.510
If true he is either child or old.

99
07:23.630 --> 07:29.940
So this he's eligible or he or she is eligible otherwise not eligible.

100
07:30.030 --> 07:32.550
So let us write a program for this one.

101
07:32.550 --> 07:33.800
So already we have this.

102
07:34.020 --> 07:36.660
So just i have to give a condition and give a message.

103
07:36.870 --> 07:44.520
Here I will write the condition if age is less than 12 OR means || we use and age is

104
07:44.610 --> 07:46.240
greater than 50.

105
07:46.350 --> 07:50.520
Then we will print a message by saying cout eligible

106
07:52.940 --> 07:58.910
otherwise means else just have to give a message that is not eligible.

107
07:59.850 --> 08:04.450
That's all and off Main function so we'll say a return zero and end.

108
08:05.790 --> 08:11.190
That's it so again for this program also there's a coding exercise available you have to write

109
08:11.190 --> 08:12.910
on this condition right.

110
08:12.940 --> 08:17.950
The condition just it is for practising the condition and there is the demo program available so you can watch

111
08:17.950 --> 08:24.610
the program and try the program by yourself and also PDF available and beyond that we have a few more

112
08:24.700 --> 08:30.450
coding exercises so where some time conditions is asked and some time you are asked for a complete

113
08:30.490 --> 08:34.330
code so I read the coding exercise properly and solve.
