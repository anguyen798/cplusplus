00:01.080 --> 00:06.990
Let us write a program to take the age of a person and check whether he's young or not so for that I

1
00:06.990 --> 00:12.030
will declare a variable called age and cout

2
00:16.250 --> 00:17.990
enter your age

3
00:20.780 --> 00:24.460
then cin age, a condition

4
00:24.470 --> 00:29.630
We have already seen that age is greater than or equal to twelve.

5
00:30.530 --> 00:37.150
And age is less than or equal to 50.

6
00:37.310 --> 00:40.630
Then we will see he's young.

7
00:40.640 --> 00:42.980
cout young

8
00:46.450 --> 00:51.410
else see out.

9
00:51.420 --> 00:57.720
Not young.

10
00:57.930 --> 00:58.500
That's it.

11
00:59.010 --> 01:02.660
So this will check the conditions so two conditions are there.

12
01:02.670 --> 01:05.300
So this is a compound conditional statement.

13
01:05.670 --> 01:06.870
Let us run it and see

14
01:10.700 --> 01:12.060
is asking for age.

15
01:12.080 --> 01:14.800
I will enter ten years not young.

16
01:14.810 --> 01:16.190
You can see the message here.

17
01:16.410 --> 01:17.360
It's not young

18
01:21.220 --> 01:22.680
age is thirty.

19
01:22.790 --> 01:27.170
So the message is young you are young.

20
01:27.320 --> 01:27.990
Let me try.

21
01:27.990 --> 01:30.810
comma here and see what happens.

22
01:30.830 --> 01:33.620
I have given comma it's a warning you see.

23
01:33.620 --> 01:37.200
Possible misuse of comma because comma is not used here.

24
01:37.190 --> 01:42.930
We use compound conditional statement, we logical operators here.

25
01:43.040 --> 01:48.440
If I'm using comma then the first condition whether it's true or false it will execute only based on

26
01:48.440 --> 01:51.230
the second condition.

27
01:51.410 --> 01:54.760
If the number is less than 50 it will look.

28
01:55.250 --> 01:56.960
Let us run and see.

29
01:57.530 --> 02:05.050
I'm giving age as a minus 5 which is less than or equal to 50 so it is less than equal to 50.

30
02:05.180 --> 02:08.290
I'm giving five minus five young.

31
02:08.420 --> 02:13.350
I got a message that it is young because first condition though it was false.

32
02:13.390 --> 02:16.510
But the second condition in was true so it has entered into this one.

33
02:16.890 --> 02:19.510
So it will check these two conditions independently.

34
02:19.550 --> 02:25.880
If we write comma here so coma is not use here you should use either and or OR.

35
02:26.090 --> 02:27.930
So as per our condition.

36
02:27.980 --> 02:35.680
AND is useful, now we convert this program using order.

37
02:35.900 --> 02:43.390
Now let us convert this program to take age and check if he's eligible for some offer or not.

38
02:43.400 --> 02:51.260
Like if age is less than 12 years or if age is greater than 50.

39
02:51.260 --> 02:53.390
Then he is eligible for an offer.

40
02:53.840 --> 02:55.760
So I'll make a message that

41
02:59.430 --> 03:04.910
eligible otherwise not eligible.

42
03:10.550 --> 03:11.330
See here.

43
03:11.490 --> 03:16.580
Age of a person is taken and the condition is check whether he is less than 12 means he is

44
03:16.580 --> 03:19.070
a child or greater than 50 means,

45
03:19.070 --> 03:20.250
He an old man.

46
03:20.300 --> 03:24.320
So suppose the offer is valid only for children and old people.

47
03:24.470 --> 03:29.700
Then cout eligible otherwise not eligible.

48
03:29.850 --> 03:30.920
I run the program

49
03:34.610 --> 03:37.820
and mention age as 60.

50
03:37.830 --> 03:41.300
So I got a message that is eligible.

51
03:41.400 --> 03:49.900
I'll run the program once again and now i will mentioned age that is 30 so I get a message that is not eligible.

52
03:49.910 --> 03:51.750
The participants not eligible.
