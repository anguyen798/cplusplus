00:00.420 --> 00:01.980
Let us look at such case.

00:03.880 --> 00:06.570
This is a branch and control statement.

00:06.580 --> 00:08.800
It is just like a switchboard at home.

00:09.250 --> 00:12.860
Whichever thing you want to put on, you have to press that switch on.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.410
So it is just like that.

00:14.500 --> 00:18.700
So this is the construct of switch case, the statement switch.

00:18.700 --> 00:25.270
Here you can write something, expression or a variable, anything, but you can mention either integer

00:25.270 --> 00:29.080
type or character type variable or an expression.

00:29.560 --> 00:34.270
And for the different values of this expression, you can mention various cases.

00:34.270 --> 00:39.910
So I have example mentioned case one and case two and there is a space mostly people do mistake here,

00:39.910 --> 00:43.930
they don't give a space here, so they face a problem.

00:43.930 --> 00:47.980
It will not be a syntax error, but it works but doesn't give the result.

00:48.520 --> 00:50.140
Then colon followed by that.

00:50.140 --> 00:57.640
You can write what all you want under this case, then break the case and break and default is optional.

00:58.090 --> 01:03.250
So if the cases are not mentioned for the other cases you can mention default.

01:03.460 --> 01:05.110
Let us see how it works.

01:05.350 --> 01:06.850
The value of this expression.

01:06.850 --> 01:10.000
If it is one, then this case is executed and break.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.200
It will come out here.

01:12.310 --> 01:16.930
If the value of this expression is two, then it will directly jump to case two and it will execute

01:16.930 --> 01:19.180
this statement and break and come out here.

01:20.110 --> 01:26.110
If you mention the value as of 903 or any other number apart from one and two, it will jump on to default

01:26.110 --> 01:28.960
and then there is nothing, so it will come out of switch.

01:30.340 --> 01:35.830
So one important thing is if you don't give this break, then if the value of the expression is one,

01:35.830 --> 01:40.840
then it will execute case one, followed by that it will execute case two also then break and it will

01:40.840 --> 01:41.380
come out.

01:43.060 --> 01:44.980
So it will execute both the cases.

01:45.340 --> 01:49.480
So for every case, you have to mention a break.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.980
If you don't need it, then you can skip it.

01:52.030 --> 01:54.560
So you should know clearly whether you need it or not.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.410
Otherwise, you make it as mandatory.

01:57.040 --> 01:57.730
Next.

01:58.150 --> 01:58.940
Next thing.

01:58.960 --> 01:59.410
What?

01:59.410 --> 02:01.330
All the cases you want you can mention.

02:01.330 --> 02:03.810
And if you don't want default, you can avoid it.

02:03.820 --> 02:05.650
And you can write on default anyway.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.820
It's optional.

02:06.850 --> 02:10.360
If it is written anywhere else, then you should have a break followed by that.

02:11.570 --> 02:12.710
Now next thing.

02:13.890 --> 02:17.530
If it is integer type, then I can write cases as one, two, three, four.

02:17.550 --> 02:22.110
So if it is character type, then I can use cases like this.

02:23.370 --> 02:25.200
A Encodes.

02:26.130 --> 02:28.190
B encodes.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.930
So if the value of character is A, then this will execute.

02:30.930 --> 02:32.870
B then this will execute and so on.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.640
So I can even use character labels.

02:36.660 --> 02:40.890
Also, so the activities are called as labels, so you can use labels in the form of characters.

02:40.890 --> 02:43.170
Also where this which case is useful.

02:43.170 --> 02:46.280
Mostly it is useful for writing menu driven program.

02:46.290 --> 02:53.460
For example, if I take the example of notepad in notepad we will have the menu that is file, and in

02:53.460 --> 03:00.390
that file the options will be there like new open save, save as.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.760
Now for each I can mention some code behind this one.

03:05.770 --> 03:07.510
If this is click, let us say it is one.

03:07.510 --> 03:10.570
If this is click, let us say it is two, then three, then four.

03:10.630 --> 03:15.730
So four depending on the value that is clicked, we can execute that particular case.

03:15.730 --> 03:20.260
If the case is one our cases two, we cannot give strings here.

03:20.260 --> 03:22.450
You cannot write a new in course here.

03:22.450 --> 03:26.950
So you have to use numbers or alphabets so we can assign some codes to this.

03:26.950 --> 03:29.110
If this is click do this work.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.150
If this is click, then do this work.

03:31.150 --> 03:38.170
So for every menu option, I can define the cases and even inside the case I can have against which

03:38.170 --> 03:41.380
also so we can have nested switch also.

03:42.690 --> 03:43.550
Like for five.

03:43.560 --> 03:46.400
Minow One case in that case, again switch.

03:46.410 --> 03:51.140
If one is pressed the new tools press then open like that we can mention the case.

03:51.150 --> 03:54.120
So menus are designed using switch cases.

03:54.120 --> 03:56.760
When we do that type of programming, we will see that.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.290
Let us look at an example.

03:58.290 --> 04:05.280
Using Switch case, I will write a program to take our day number and display the name Main.

04:05.670 --> 04:18.420
Here I will take a variable day and see out and day number see in.

04:19.690 --> 04:20.320
Dave.

04:22.210 --> 04:23.230
Switch.

04:24.610 --> 04:30.820
C Whatever the value is given based on that day in case if it is one.

04:32.570 --> 04:38.840
Then see out Monday and break.

04:40.560 --> 04:51.360
Then key is to see out Tuesday and then give a break goes on.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.240
Default.

04:54.120 --> 04:58.460
If it is any other value like other than 1 to 7 days will be there.

04:58.470 --> 05:04.890
Other than that we can see out in value today close end of a program.

05:05.100 --> 05:09.930
So this program will take our daily number and it will display the name of our day, whether it is Monday

05:09.930 --> 05:10.950
or Tuesday or so on.

05:10.980 --> 05:12.490
That's all about such case.

05:12.510 --> 05:17.400
You can type this program by yourself and you can test it on your machine because simultaneously practice

05:17.400 --> 05:18.580
is more important.

05:18.600 --> 05:22.380
Practice will make you perfect on C++, so practice this one.

05:22.380 --> 05:25.020
And the next video is on the program.

05:25.020 --> 05:25.830
Sample program.
