Here is an exercise program that you have to write.

1
00:03.210 --> 00:08.930
So you have to take a year and check whether it's a leap year or not.

2
00:08.940 --> 00:09.970
a leap year

3
00:09.990 --> 00:17.070
If it is divisible by four and if it is a century  year that is it is divisible by 100 then it should also

4
00:17.070 --> 00:21.420
be divisible by 400 then only it is called as leap year.

5
00:21.420 --> 00:28.780
I repeat once again if a yeAR IS divisible by 4 AND hen it is a leap year and if it is also divisible by 100 that is

6
00:28.790 --> 00:32.410
a century year then it should also be divisible by 400.

7
00:32.640 --> 00:38.130
So you have to write a program which will take the year as input and based on these conditions you have

8
00:38.130 --> 00:44.340
to find out weather it is a leap year or not here I will run the program and show you and how it should

9
00:44.340 --> 00:46.380
work what should be the input and output.

10
00:46.440 --> 00:53.150
So you can see the program and even the program file is given as pdf in the resource.

11
00:53.190 --> 00:57.900
You can download that if you face any difficulty in writing this program.

12
00:57.960 --> 01:03.370
Now here is a program, let me run this program for finding that it is a leap year or not.

13
01:03.630 --> 01:13.880
I've learned it if I give the year as 2020 then it's a leap year.

14
01:14.260 --> 01:16.930
See the message is 2020 is a leap year.

15
01:17.140 --> 01:23.090
I re-run the program and I will say two one double zero then it's not a leap year.

16
01:23.260 --> 01:24.630
It's a century year.

17
01:24.850 --> 01:28.980
It is not divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400.

18
01:29.200 --> 01:31.330
So you have to write the conditions for this one.

19
01:31.330 --> 01:36.370
So the important thing in this program is writting the conditions so already I have explained what

20
01:36.370 --> 01:37.730
does it mean by leap year.

21
01:37.930 --> 01:45.400
So write this program it should give give the output like this. otherwise afterwards you can check the program file that

22
01:45.400 --> 01:46.940
is available as pdf.
