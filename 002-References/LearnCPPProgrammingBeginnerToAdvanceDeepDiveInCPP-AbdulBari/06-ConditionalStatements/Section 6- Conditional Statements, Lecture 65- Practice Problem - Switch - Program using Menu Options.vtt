switch cases are used for writing menu driven programs let's write

1
00:05.730 --> 00:16.240
One example, simple menu driven program for taking a menu option for Performing Arithmetic operations.

2
00:16.260 --> 00:23.600
So what I will do here is I take a menu option then based on the menu option I will perform a specific task.

3
00:23.700 --> 00:30.920
So let me prepare some program then you can see. first I will display a menu on the screen that is menu

4
00:31.200 --> 00:34.740
slash n then cout

5
00:38.350 --> 00:39.840
first option is.

6
00:39.890 --> 00:50.350
Add then slash n if I can a single line then the second option is subtract and slash n and third

7
00:50.380 --> 00:58.900
option is multiply and then slash n fourth option is

8
01:04.050 --> 01:10.860
divide and slash n that's it.

9
01:10.860 --> 01:14.870
So I have written in a single cout statement all four menu options.

10
01:14.930 --> 01:20.550
Then here I will declare a variable option.

11
01:20.730 --> 01:27.160
Then I will say cout enter your choice.

12
01:30.310 --> 01:38.770
Then cin I read options from Keyboard whatever the option may be I take two numbers and I will perform

13
01:38.770 --> 01:45.250
the operation based on the option so for that I would take two numbers so far I am declaring variables and

14
01:45.250 --> 01:54.940
also I have declared C then I will say cout enter two numbers so that operation can be performed on

15
01:54.940 --> 01:55.720
them.

16
01:56.210 --> 02:11.250
I read A and B then switch based on option. if it is case 1 if he has selected case 1 then I will say

17
02:11.260 --> 02:21.210
c assign  A-plus B, A and B will be added and the result is stored in C And if it is case two then c

18
02:21.260 --> 02:39.600
Assign A minus B and result is stored in C. case 3 then c assign A multiplied by B then break then

19
02:39.610 --> 02:47.050
case four C assign A divided by B then break.

20
02:47.050 --> 02:58.630
After this I will say cout, result is then displays C and also endl then

21
03:01.350 --> 03:03.390
that's it it is complete program with

22
03:03.430 --> 03:11.650
Me. its giving a warning that C might have not been initialized means if the option is not available then

23
03:11.650 --> 03:20.560
C means uninitialized so ignored the warning and run the program.

24
03:20.620 --> 03:25.630
Now you can see that here is a menu and all the menu options are given.

25
03:25.720 --> 03:31.150
If I select the menu option as one then it ask for two numbers 12 and 3

26
03:34.240 --> 03:37.240
result is 15.

27
03:37.610 --> 03:39.910
So it has added two numbers.

28
03:40.310 --> 03:47.850
If I run it again and enter the option as 2 and enter two numbers like 12 and 3.

29
03:47.900 --> 03:49.240
Then the result is nine.

30
03:49.250 --> 03:52.060
It has subtracted two numbers.

31
03:52.340 --> 03:55.030
I will run the program once again.

32
03:55.040 --> 03:57.150
Now the option is 3.

33
03:57.480 --> 04:03.350
I will enter 2l numbers 10 and 2 so it is 20 this is multiplying them.

34
04:03.350 --> 04:05.410
So that's all.

35
04:05.420 --> 04:06.530
So.

36
04:06.920 --> 04:07.290
So that's how

37
04:07.290 --> 04:12.330
it is taking an option and performing a particular operation depending on the option.

38
04:12.530 --> 04:17.330
So there is a switch case and this is used as menul driven program.

39
04:17.330 --> 04:19.720
You can see how the program is working.

40
04:19.790 --> 04:24.580
It is giving a menu and asking us to select one of the options from the menu.

41
04:24.650 --> 04:31.370
If I select the four then it is asking two numbers ten and five on it is giving the result depending

42
04:31.370 --> 04:33.160
on the option given fourth option.

43
04:33.170 --> 04:36.310
So it is dividing two numbers.

44
04:36.890 --> 04:39.100
So you can try this program on your computer.
