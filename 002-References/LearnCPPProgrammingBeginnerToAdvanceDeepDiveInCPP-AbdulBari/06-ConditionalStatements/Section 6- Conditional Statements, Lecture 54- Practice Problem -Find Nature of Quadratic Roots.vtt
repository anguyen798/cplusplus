00:00.850 --> 00:05.950
So we have learned about nested if statements so we will use that in the program.

1
00:05.950 --> 00:08.330
So one example program is here.

2
00:08.560 --> 00:16.030
This is to check the nature of the roots of quadratic equation first i will explain what does it mean

3
00:16.180 --> 00:25.660
and then I'll show you a program using nested if, see here I have got a quadratic equation, a equation whose

4
00:25.700 --> 00:31.360
degree is two is called as quadratic X squared plus X plus nothing.

5
00:31.370 --> 00:36.750
That is 1 So a X square plus b x plus c is equal to zero.

6
00:36.860 --> 00:39.800
If it is zero equal to zero then you can find the roots.

7
00:40.070 --> 00:43.820
So then only it is called as equation that is quadratic equation.

8
00:43.820 --> 00:48.990
We already learned in the previous videos but again i am repeating it. then roots,

9
00:49.000 --> 00:50.440
What is the formula.

10
00:50.480 --> 00:52.340
every student knows this one.

11
00:52.340 --> 00:58.620
The formula is minus B plus or minus square root of  minus b square  minus 4 a c by 2 a is the formula.

12
00:58.910 --> 01:05.440
Now if you know the values of ABC you can substitute them here and you can get the root, and for getting

13
01:05.450 --> 01:06.400
the root.

14
01:06.470 --> 01:09.000
Another time we take minus we get another root.

15
01:09.140 --> 01:12.530
So actually we get two routes right because this is quadratic.

16
01:12.590 --> 01:15.200
So two values of X are possible.

17
01:15.200 --> 01:25.490
No let us come to the point see inside this root if B square minus four AC is becoming 0 or if this

18
01:25.490 --> 01:33.830
whole thing is a zero then what happens minus B plus zero or minus B minus zero.

19
01:33.980 --> 01:41.460
It's the same thing only, so zero has no value if b squared minus 4 a c as he has became zero zero has

20
01:41.460 --> 01:42.420
no value.

21
01:42.420 --> 01:43.280
Whether you take.

22
01:43.280 --> 01:48.910
Plus or minus you get the same answer, what is  that minus b by the 2 you get the same answer

23
01:49.350 --> 01:50.310
minus b by 2a.

24
01:50.340 --> 01:51.890
So that value is zero.

25
01:51.900 --> 01:56.820
So this means if you take both the roots, both the roots are same only because if you take plus zero

26
01:56.830 --> 02:00.190
also you get the same answer minus zero also same answer.

27
02:00.300 --> 02:02.830
So it looks like this minus B plus zero.

28
02:02.850 --> 02:08.550
By 2 a or minus B minus zero by 2a. see zero has no value.

29
02:08.550 --> 02:14.350
So both the roots are same only, so both the routes will be equal means this B squared minus four

30
02:14.370 --> 02:16.970
AC for it is zero then would that also be equal.

31
02:17.160 --> 02:25.840
that's it.  then, one more time if that B square minus 4ac is than zero, let's say

32
02:25.890 --> 02:29.010
Example Let's say we got minus five.

33
02:29.070 --> 02:31.290
Do you know the root of minus five.

34
02:31.290 --> 02:33.920
No we cannot find the route of minus five.

35
02:33.930 --> 02:36.580
So it means we cannot know the routes.

36
02:36.660 --> 02:40.310
Then what do you call if you have a root to another minus one.

37
02:40.350 --> 02:42.760
We send them what is imaginary imaginary.

38
02:42.780 --> 02:47.940
We don't know the answer so we cannot find the roots so we learn two things.

39
02:47.970 --> 02:55.140
If that portion is zero, roots are same only. if that portion is negative we cannot find routes if it is

40
02:55.140 --> 02:59.620
positive then we have two routes and they are not saying they are different.

41
03:00.060 --> 03:02.230
So that's what look at this now.

42
03:02.280 --> 03:04.410
Look at this now discriminant.

43
03:04.530 --> 03:07.810
So this b square minus 4ac means discriminant.

44
03:07.890 --> 03:15.180
Let us say d,now that d is zero means roots are real and equal

45
03:15.540 --> 03:22.530
That's what I said they are equal and if d is greater than zero means they are real but they

46
03:22.530 --> 03:25.310
are not equal they will be different. third one,

47
03:25.590 --> 03:29.490
If d is less than zero means they are not real they are imaginary.

48
03:30.300 --> 03:37.120
So if you have any quadratic equations, there are three different natures of quadratic equation roots of quadratic

49
03:37.120 --> 03:39.460
equation they may be real and equal.

50
03:39.550 --> 03:41.620
they may be real and unequal.

51
03:41.740 --> 03:44.010
They may be imaginary.

52
03:44.010 --> 03:48.000
So if else then if else, like this we have a case here.

53
03:48.030 --> 03:53.120
So we have to do nested if so let us write on the program directly.

54
03:53.220 --> 04:00.060
So here inside the program I have variable for ABCD and the roots also ABC for the coefficient

55
04:00.060 --> 04:06.820
of this quadratic equation on ABC, and these for discriminant and root 1 and 2 for finding 2 roots.

56
04:06.890 --> 04:13.180
Now already I have taken the ABC 3 values then here first out discriminant.

57
04:13.320 --> 04:14.930
So let us find our discriminant.

58
04:14.980 --> 04:24.210
d is assigned with B square that is b*b minus 4aC that is 4*a*c we got the

59
04:24.220 --> 04:25.460
discriminant

60
04:25.920 --> 04:26.620
Next.

61
04:26.670 --> 04:29.600
No I have to write if and else, first one.

62
04:29.760 --> 04:38.310
If this  D is equal to zero, means roots are equal and real.

63
04:38.400 --> 04:41.540
So I will give a message C out.

64
04:41.650 --> 04:45.210
roots are real and equal.

65
04:45.300 --> 04:49.120
roots are real and equal I will finish writing.

66
04:49.510 --> 04:52.020
Then after this I want to display roots also.

67
04:52.020 --> 04:53.840
That is minus B by 2a.

68
04:53.850 --> 04:57.230
So here next line, see here

69
04:57.240 --> 04:58.410
After this I should write endl

70
04:58.410 --> 05:01.130
And then what there is no space overlaid here.

71
05:01.140 --> 05:05.210
You can even write and then in the beginning of the display part also.

72
05:05.260 --> 05:11.670
Show endl, what I should display when the roos are equal minus B by 2a so directly i will write

73
05:11.670 --> 05:20.500
down here minus B divided by two in two A and this should be in the bracket and this entire thing also

74
05:20.510 --> 05:21.380
if it is in brackets.

75
05:21.390 --> 05:22.790
That's better.

76
05:22.920 --> 05:28.130
So this entire result you get, roots are real and equal.

77
05:28.300 --> 05:33.950
then you get the result.  it is single value because they are equal.

78
05:34.250 --> 05:36.890
This is inside if d is equal to zero.

79
05:38.420 --> 05:42.710
If d is not zero then what it could be, greater than zero, less than zero.

80
05:42.920 --> 05:47.310
So let us write for, greater than zero. else,

81
05:47.690 --> 05:56.330
So here itself I can write on if d the greater than zero, actually I can write flower bracket inside the

82
05:56.330 --> 06:02.510
bracket also I can write because just after else I have if so I can make it here itself.

83
06:02.690 --> 06:10.340
Then if d is greater than zero then I will cout the roots are real and unequal so I will write down this one

84
06:10.340 --> 06:13.520
roots are real and unequal.

85
06:13.700 --> 06:20.210
Then I will display both the roots so first is endl, I will display them in a new line.

86
06:20.210 --> 06:33.710
Then first roots is minus B plus sqrt of d then this whole thing divided by 

87
06:33.940 --> 06:35.000
2*a

88
06:35.180 --> 06:38.510
This is one result then again, Cout

89
06:40.220 --> 06:46.040
And endl, this whole thing as it is just right minus here.

90
06:46.670 --> 06:52.340
so this is for positive and this for negative I don't have to write on this completely already.

91
06:52.340 --> 06:58.040
We have done that in the previous video in the beginning videos so that same forum that you can write

92
06:58.040 --> 07:02.360
on here like the at last at last.

93
07:02.590 --> 07:09.230
else means if this is not equal, this is not the creator then else.

94
07:09.230 --> 07:16.900
So here else I have only single statement so say cout, imaginary.

95
07:16.900 --> 07:19.220
scribling  here because there is no space.

96
07:19.400 --> 07:22.530
So you can understand this, it is imaginary.

97
07:23.210 --> 07:25.490
So I guess you have understood how to write on this one.

98
07:25.520 --> 07:29.360
So write a program by yourself and also there is a demo available.

99
07:29.360 --> 07:34.690
This is for displaying the nature of the roots as well as you are displaying the roots.

100
07:35.480 --> 07:36.560
So that's all in this video.
