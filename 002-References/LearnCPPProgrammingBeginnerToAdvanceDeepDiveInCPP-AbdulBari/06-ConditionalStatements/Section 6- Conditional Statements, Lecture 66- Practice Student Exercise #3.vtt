And here is an exercise program that you have to develop, so program you have to write down for calculating

1
00:06.110 --> 00:08.070
discounted bill amount.

2
00:08.130 --> 00:14.820
So the input a program will take  is the total bill amount and it will give the discount as follows If it

3
00:14.820 --> 00:19.170
is greater than 500 then it is 20 percent discount is  given.

4
00:19.170 --> 00:25.170
So you are supposed to take the input as bill amount and based on the bill amount calculate the discount and

5
00:25.590 --> 00:30.780
subtract discount from the amount and display a discounted price.

6
00:31.140 --> 00:36.780
And here I can show you the program How it should run and what should be the input and output of the

7
00:36.780 --> 00:42.370
program file is given in the form of pdf if you the difficulty in writing the program you can check the

8
00:42.360 --> 00:43.570
code.

9
00:44.070 --> 00:47.520
Here is a program for calculating discounted bill amount.

10
00:47.540 --> 00:52.050
I will run the program and show you how the input output is expected.

11
00:52.050 --> 01:00.540
See here is asking Bill amount, if I say bill amount is 1000 and the amount is > than 500 So 20 percent

12
01:00.540 --> 01:01.830
discount is given.

13
01:01.890 --> 01:08.610
I will re run the the program and I will give the amount as a 400 so 10 percent discount I will get.

14
01:08.640 --> 01:14.830
So discount is 40 here you can see that the discount is 40 and the discounted amount is 360. i will run

15
01:14.880 --> 01:16.110
the program once again.

16
01:16.110 --> 01:25.740
And i will give the amount as 50 it is less than 100 so discounted zero and the Bill amount is 50 only we should

17
01:25.740 --> 01:28.020
write the program which works like this.

18
01:28.220 --> 01:32.590
And if you are unable to do that you can check the program that is available as pdf.
