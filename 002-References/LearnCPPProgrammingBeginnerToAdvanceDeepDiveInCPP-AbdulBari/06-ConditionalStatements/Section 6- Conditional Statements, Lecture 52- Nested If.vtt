00:00.240 --> 00:04.010
In this video we will learn about Nested conditional statement.

1
00:04.080 --> 00:05.150
It is Called as nested if.

2
00:05.310 --> 00:10.800
what does it mean let us learn that at first,  then I will show you a program on that one.

3
00:11.500 --> 00:13.980
So let us see Nested if see here.

4
00:13.990 --> 00:20.430
This is a conditional statement from here to here is if block and here to here is an else block.

5
00:20.470 --> 00:25.720
So this is an if statement as statements, else statements. if and else block. inside if,

6
00:25.810 --> 00:29.020
Again there is a if and else block, can you write like this.

7
00:29.020 --> 00:32.970
Yes you can write depends on your problem depends on your requirement.

8
00:33.040 --> 00:33.250
Right.

9
00:33.550 --> 00:38.950
So inside if also you can have its own again if and else if required.

10
00:39.070 --> 00:41.690
Also inside else also so you can write.

11
00:41.830 --> 00:44.140
Yes I have one more thing.

12
00:44.140 --> 00:45.730
Can I write if again inside this.

13
00:45.820 --> 00:49.380
Yes you can write if and else up to any nested level.

14
00:49.960 --> 00:52.630
So this is supported by C++.

15
00:52.630 --> 00:53.590
So that's it.

16
00:53.740 --> 00:58.540
In some cases we need to write nested conditional statements like this.

17
00:58.810 --> 01:05.100
And most of the time it happens to be here inside else block rather than iF block.

18
01:05.200 --> 01:09.710
Mostly it will be inside else block. if so and so else,

19
01:09.750 --> 01:12.050
in else again if so and so.

20
01:12.070 --> 01:17.340
So we write this. we will be using this type of conditional statement many times in our program.

21
01:17.350 --> 01:18.640
So we will come across them.

22
01:18.820 --> 01:19.030
Right.

23
01:19.450 --> 01:23.020
So that's all about nested if. now I have an example,

24
01:23.020 --> 01:29.220
So let us take an example and use nested if statements for writing a program.

25
01:29.590 --> 01:31.900
So for that already I have a flowchart here.

26
01:32.140 --> 01:35.800
So let me take example and explain you about the flowchart and the problem.

27
01:35.800 --> 01:36.810
Then I will write a program.

28
01:37.840 --> 01:41.980
Let us write the program for finding GREATEST OF THREE NUMBERS.

29
01:41.980 --> 01:45.670
Suppose I have three numbers as input ABC.

30
01:45.670 --> 01:46.620
I have this input.

31
01:47.110 --> 01:50.310
I want to find out who is having greatest number.

32
01:50.350 --> 01:53.940
Actually these are three variables in which variable we have greatest number.

33
01:54.400 --> 01:59.590
So let us check it. if suppose this is having value 10 and this is having value 5 and this

34
01:59.590 --> 02:03.120
is three then which is a greater? a.

35
02:03.580 --> 02:05.070
How do you say a is greater than 

36
02:05.290 --> 02:13.600
All because a is greater than b and A is greater than C so when a can be greater that it should

37
02:13.600 --> 02:19.320
be greater than b also  and it should be greater than c also then we can say a is greater.

38
02:19.510 --> 02:28.180
So it means if a is greater than B as well as means AND it a should be greater  than

39
02:28.180 --> 02:31.300
C then who is greater?a is greater.

40
02:31.380 --> 02:32.400
Right, a is greater.

41
02:32.400 --> 02:35.290
just i will write down here,  it's not a C++ code.

42
02:36.140 --> 02:42.200
So if suppose a is not having ten it is having value 2

43
02:42.620 --> 02:43.990
Then what happens.

44
02:44.250 --> 02:45.540
Check this a is greater .

45
02:45.550 --> 02:51.350
Then B, no a  itself is not greater than B it's not greater than c. first of all a is not greater than  B.

46
02:51.350 --> 02:51.950
That is false.

47
02:51.950 --> 02:53.900
So this is false.

48
02:53.900 --> 02:56.270
And even if this is true then it fails.

49
02:56.300 --> 02:57.990
But this also false.

50
02:58.090 --> 03:05.570
So if a is 4 then this is false and this is true this will be true then what is the result of

51
03:05.570 --> 03:06.040
AND.

52
03:06.230 --> 03:12.250
You know we have known about this a logical operators so false and true is a false.

53
03:12.250 --> 03:19.210
So A is not a greater than who is greater if a is not greater than then two are remaining B and

54
03:19.210 --> 03:24.760
C so either B is good or C is greater. let us compare them so afterwards.

55
03:24.840 --> 03:25.840
Else.

56
03:25.900 --> 03:32.120
else if B is greater than C then B is a greater right.

57
03:32.130 --> 03:40.670
B is bring down on in this also ends C is great that design writing pseudocode like thing.

58
03:40.880 --> 03:41.780
It's not a program.

59
03:42.260 --> 03:45.310
So if a is good to then boarded an eighth grader.

60
03:45.500 --> 03:47.840
Otherwise b or c can we get.

61
03:47.880 --> 03:53.520
So it is good to then see we don't have to compare it in all just we would see among two one is gone.

62
03:53.570 --> 03:53.800
Right.

63
03:53.810 --> 03:55.990
One is gone is gone.

64
03:56.010 --> 03:56.900
Like a lot of data.

65
03:56.930 --> 04:00.510
So what we meaning B and C it B is good to then see.

66
04:00.620 --> 04:01.780
Otherwise C is good.

67
04:01.910 --> 04:05.750
So this is all we can check the greatest of three numbers.

68
04:05.810 --> 04:10.470
So already you have a flowchart here and between them what's ABC and here I am checking if it is greater

69
04:10.470 --> 04:20.360
than B as often as I used to then see if true this should be true if true then print a and stop I was

70
04:20.480 --> 04:27.890
missing this is false then what is possible B good at it and see if B is good at and C then print B

71
04:28.280 --> 04:29.170
and then stop.

72
04:29.270 --> 04:29.990
If this is true

73
04:32.630 --> 04:36.750
else if not then who is good at it last season.

74
04:36.790 --> 04:37.140
Good.

75
04:37.570 --> 04:38.310
And stop.

76
04:38.470 --> 04:42.820
So there are two conditional statement conditional statement and again conditional statement.

77
04:43.390 --> 04:46.670
So let us see how to write on this in a C++ program.

78
04:46.810 --> 04:48.150
I relied on the program here.

79
04:49.450 --> 04:54.880
So here is a program I have a main function although written partially I have three variables because

80
04:55.150 --> 05:02.560
we need three variables that enter three numbers then read seen a b c we are reading the variance right

81
05:03.490 --> 05:13.600
now I have to write on the punishment statements if it is greater than B and it is greater than C then

82
05:13.600 --> 05:18.220
I have to print that a C out just a.

83
05:18.250 --> 05:22.500
So actually I want I'm not giving a message to just Sam displaying a grade on them.

84
05:22.520 --> 05:26.680
That's what I saw on the screen only them but it will appear next.

85
05:26.680 --> 05:29.770
Else is inside Ms.

86
05:29.860 --> 05:36.690
Again check if B is greater than C if so c out.

87
05:36.910 --> 05:42.040
B else C out.

88
05:42.050 --> 05:45.770
C Not one more thing I have to explain your here.

89
05:45.940 --> 05:52.200
C inside this as we have a finance so that I know floor I get because these are single statements not

90
05:52.310 --> 05:59.230
f just inside else if they're just off after rails only separated by flow back and then we can write

91
05:59.230 --> 06:07.870
on this if followed by this one also B is greater than C then here I can see C out B right.

92
06:08.230 --> 06:16.660
And finally here again right Edwards and c c out C so this will be unlisted nested if a statement only

93
06:16.900 --> 06:18.220
you can even write like this.

94
06:18.220 --> 06:26.250
So if I read now if he is get it and b earnings get it and c I don't see if B's here at NC ls C..

95
06:26.770 --> 06:33.470
So this is all we can write can nested conditional statement that is nested if I write.

96
06:34.220 --> 06:36.660
So there is a coding exercise for this one.

97
06:36.680 --> 06:42.050
So you have to write on these conditional statements in that coding exercise only this portion you have

98
06:42.050 --> 06:42.470
to write on.

99
06:42.470 --> 06:44.460
That is spend this one or this one on this one.

100
06:44.460 --> 06:45.680
Anyone notice.

101
06:46.070 --> 06:50.510
Then there are more coding exercises you have to solve them by yourself.

102
06:50.850 --> 06:54.140
And the description is given in detail just you study it right.

103
06:54.290 --> 06:56.920
So it's not a complex problem which is a simple problem.

104
06:57.060 --> 06:59.920
Read the question and understand it and solve it.

105
06:59.960 --> 07:02.270
And if you can't solve it just give a message.

106
07:02.270 --> 07:07.670
I will reply you back under the demo will have a label for this one so watch it and I write the program

107
07:07.670 --> 07:09.380
by yourself on your machine.

108
07:09.390 --> 07:18.290
Practice coding exercises just to make you feel confident on the topic and come from that you have understood

109
07:18.290 --> 07:20.820
the topic so that following the speech.
