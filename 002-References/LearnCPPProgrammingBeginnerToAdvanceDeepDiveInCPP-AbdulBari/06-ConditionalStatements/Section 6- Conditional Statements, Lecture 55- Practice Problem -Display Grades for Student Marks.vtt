Let us write one more program using nested if. this program is to display grades for the student based

1
00:09.480 --> 00:11.110
on their marks.

2
00:11.160 --> 00:12.970
So let us study the problem first.

3
00:12.970 --> 00:13.410
then,

4
00:13.500 --> 00:15.350
I will write down the program.

5
00:15.600 --> 00:21.280
See there are three marks from three different subjects marks1,  marks2  marks3.

6
00:21.300 --> 00:29.030
We will take input ask three marks then find total then find average then based on the average marks

7
00:29.070 --> 00:31.720
we will display grades for the students.

8
00:31.770 --> 00:36.320
So if average marks are greater than or equal to 60 we say Grade A.

9
00:36.870 --> 00:42.780
If they are between 35 to 16 less than 60 but greater than equal to 35 we will say b grade, if it is less

10
00:42.780 --> 00:43.770
than 35.

11
00:43.770 --> 00:46.010
Then we say it's a grade C like fail.

12
00:46.500 --> 00:48.260
So I have just taken three grades.

13
00:48.270 --> 00:51.360
If you want you can increase grades in this one.

14
00:51.390 --> 00:56.290
Now how to display the grade.   just i will display the grade, total of marks and avg of marks

15
00:56.330 --> 00:58.610
I will not display that, i will just display grades.

16
00:58.690 --> 01:03.590
Ok so you can display is so and so,grades is so and so, everything you can display.

17
01:03.810 --> 01:05.030
Let us write down this one.

18
01:05.160 --> 01:07.260
So for this three conditions are there.

19
01:07.560 --> 01:10.700
So for this I have to write nested if.

20
01:11.040 --> 01:16.740
So here is a program already i have written partial  program, marks1, marks 2, marks3,  total are

21
01:16.750 --> 01:19.550
of type int,  average in float.

22
01:19.680 --> 01:26.190
Then enter marks of three subjects andm1, m2, m3 three marks are taken. adding m1,m2,m3

23
01:26.190 --> 01:29.820
we get total,  total by three point zero

24
01:29.820 --> 01:38.430
We get average. why point zero? because you know total is Integer, 3 is also integer so we

25
01:38.430 --> 01:40.480
get integer division right.

26
01:40.800 --> 01:48.260
So we get decimal part truncated, if we want decimal part then typecast or other method is 3.0.

27
01:48.270 --> 01:53.160
This is float, so the result would be float if anyone number is flawed then that other will be float.

28
01:53.160 --> 01:56.310
Not here let us display the grade.

29
01:56.430 --> 02:08.550
So First of all, if average is greater than or equal to 60 then cout a just as grade.

30
02:08.640 --> 02:11.750
And also endl, if at all you want new light you can take that.

31
02:12.280 --> 02:15.880
Then I have only one statement inside this just I want to display.

32
02:15.880 --> 02:16.210
grade.

33
02:16.210 --> 02:18.380
Then i said I don't want to display marks of the average.

34
02:18.390 --> 02:19.470
You can do that.

35
02:19.470 --> 02:22.120
So for me I don't need flower bracket.

36
02:22.230 --> 02:27.650
So just i will write else again if, one will condition is there, now

37
02:27.870 --> 02:36.220
Remember this is with in range 35 to 60 from 35 to 60 between means

38
02:36.270 --> 02:40.340
You have to take AND. so i have to write two conditions.

39
02:40.590 --> 02:44.310
Average is greater than or equal to 35.

40
02:44.940 --> 02:58.230
AND average that is less than 60 then for this we will display B so I can use double quotes of single

41
02:58.230 --> 03:05.700
quotes anything. single quote will be a letter, double quote  will be a string then and endl then else

42
03:05.850 --> 03:08.050
means if it is not greater than 60.

43
03:08.090 --> 03:15.450
Not between these two then definitely it is less than 35 so when it is less than 35 just we will say  cout

44
03:15.960 --> 03:17.460
grade is C

45
03:20.090 --> 03:25.170
so this all we can write nested if if as if.

46
03:25.190 --> 03:26.520
Then again if.

47
03:26.630 --> 03:32.900
So using nested if we have written this program it is a simple program so you can write down this program

48
03:32.900 --> 03:33.920
by yourself.

49
03:33.930 --> 03:34.780
Not based on this.

50
03:34.790 --> 03:37.540
There are some coding exercises you solve that.

51
03:38.060 --> 03:43.790
So based on the range of values you have to do calculations or give output so there are coding excersices

52
03:43.830 --> 03:46.820
read them properly and solve them.

53
03:47.270 --> 03:51.360
So there you may have to write on few things you don't have to take input.

54
03:51.550 --> 03:55.860
You dont have to declare the variables and take the input most of the things out in the parameters.

55
03:55.880 --> 03:58.480
So you have to write  only this part.

56
03:58.640 --> 04:00.370
So do those coding exercises.

57
04:00.380 --> 04:02.370
So I have given you sufficient idea here.

58
04:02.600 --> 04:06.990
You can easily solve them and there is a demo available for this program.

59
04:07.070 --> 04:08.510
You can watch that one.

60
04:08.690 --> 04:14.420
If you are unable to write this program and at any stage if you want my help you can just give a message

61
04:14.540 --> 04:19.700
or an questions of section you can write your message whatever the problem you are facing.

62
04:19.700 --> 04:23.900
You can make it as a question and post it. that's all in this video.
