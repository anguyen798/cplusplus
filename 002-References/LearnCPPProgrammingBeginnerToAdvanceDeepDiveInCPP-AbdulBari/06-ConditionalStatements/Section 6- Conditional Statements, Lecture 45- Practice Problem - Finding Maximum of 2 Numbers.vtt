00:00.210 --> 00:04.880
Let us write a program using conditional statements so the first program that we would like us to find

1
00:04.880 --> 00:05.980
the greatest of two number.

2
00:06.010 --> 00:08.450
that is a maximum of two numbers.

3
00:08.440 --> 00:12.940
Suppose I have two numbers x and y then I have to find out which one is greater.

4
00:13.420 --> 00:14.600
So it's very simple.

5
00:14.670 --> 00:16.480
I have to check them compare them.

6
00:16.590 --> 00:19.130
If x is greater than that values greater.

7
00:19.560 --> 00:22.640
If it is not then definitely Y is greater.

8
00:22.920 --> 00:27.920
So if and else so I have to just check the condition that is if x is greater than y.

9
00:28.470 --> 00:32.550
So for this writing this program will follow the same steps that we have used.

10
00:32.550 --> 00:38.130
These are steps in the previous programs also that is taking input processing whatever the processing

11
00:38.130 --> 00:41.730
is there then output giving the output.

12
00:41.730 --> 00:44.370
So here in our program what is the input.

13
00:44.490 --> 00:47.550
So we have these two values as input.

14
00:47.580 --> 00:47.880
Right.

15
00:47.940 --> 00:50.500
So we have to take the input then process.

16
00:50.670 --> 00:52.500
Here we don't have any processing to do.

17
00:52.500 --> 00:59.700
Just check the condition then output in output the same values x and y right? either X or Y.

18
01:00.240 --> 01:03.350
Let us draw a flow chart then we will write algorithm.

19
01:03.420 --> 01:05.320
Then we would like to program focus.

20
01:05.850 --> 01:08.230
So first I would draw a flow chart.

21
01:08.490 --> 01:11.940
Let us start flowchart starts.

22
01:11.940 --> 01:13.440
Then what is the first thing.

23
01:13.470 --> 01:14.160
Input Output.

24
01:14.160 --> 01:15.930
So I should take two numbers.

25
01:15.930 --> 01:25.830
So I should give a message using input output box and say that enter two numbers print and enter two numbers.

26
01:25.830 --> 01:27.860
Then I should read the numbers.

27
01:27.870 --> 01:32.900
So here I will use variables that are X and Y the next.

28
01:32.940 --> 01:36.560
After reading these values I should check which one is greater.

29
01:36.590 --> 01:38.770
So which one means, is x greater than y?.

30
01:38.800 --> 01:43.100
Then I should check this one so the condition block here.

31
01:43.170 --> 01:51.870
If what is the condition x is greater than y if true it will take this direction and if it false It will

32
01:51.870 --> 01:53.700
take this dedication right.

33
01:53.910 --> 01:55.460
So you can take any direction.

34
01:55.470 --> 01:56.520
So here true.

35
01:56.580 --> 02:01.090
If it is true then what we have to do here simply we will display the greater number.

36
02:01.110 --> 02:03.600
So who is it that if x is greater than x is greater.

37
02:03.690 --> 02:06.390
So I should print a message that X is great.

38
02:06.570 --> 02:15.430
So here I will directly print max number is or Max is X right.

39
02:16.190 --> 02:17.590
Then false.

40
02:17.670 --> 02:19.650
If it is false then who is greater.

41
02:19.890 --> 02:22.620
y is greater,  so maximum is y.

42
02:22.830 --> 02:26.860
So print here Max is y.

43
02:28.890 --> 02:31.990
Then after this, this is over, output is over.

44
02:32.220 --> 02:33.660
This is itself is output.

45
02:33.750 --> 02:36.230
So in this example there is no processing right.

46
02:36.450 --> 02:41.760
Then after this end of the flow chart so it will go on stop.

47
02:41.760 --> 02:47.040
So from that side also it will come and join this one.

48
02:47.160 --> 02:52.440
This is a flow chart for finding greatest or maximum of two numbers.

49
02:52.440 --> 02:53.580
Now the same thing.

50
02:53.580 --> 02:55.510
I will write it as an algorithm here.

51
02:55.540 --> 02:57.300
Then afterwards I will write it as a program.

52
02:57.510 --> 02:58.940
So algorithm.

53
02:59.190 --> 03:00.630
I will call the algorithm name as max.

54
03:00.630 --> 03:10.090
now begin, what I have to do.

55
03:10.140 --> 03:13.510
I have already shown you that these things you can directly write it here.

56
03:13.590 --> 03:16.460
but  we have if also so we will learn how to read.

57
03:16.470 --> 03:20.930
If so let us write down so first print and enter two numbers.

58
03:21.020 --> 03:34.950
Okay print Enter two numbers and then read X and Y this is over semicolons you want to give

59
03:34.950 --> 03:35.780
or dont give.

60
03:35.790 --> 03:36.770
That's up to you.

61
03:36.810 --> 03:39.510
This is your own pseudocode right.

62
03:39.750 --> 03:42.750
Then afterwards after this if is there.

63
03:42.740 --> 03:44.700
So watch this carefully.

64
03:44.880 --> 03:48.100
If x is greater than Y.

65
03:48.270 --> 03:56.620
X is greater than y then if x is greater then y, as it is I have written and then I have written then also.

66
03:56.650 --> 03:57.480
So it's a choice.

67
03:57.490 --> 04:02.870
If you dont want to write 'then' you can skip it also but it looks like a English statement.

68
04:02.950 --> 04:06.420
If x is greater than y then begin.

69
04:06.490 --> 04:07.970
So what is the inside.

70
04:08.260 --> 04:10.270
If you have to print this one.

71
04:10.330 --> 04:17.340
So print Max is X that's.

72
04:17.740 --> 04:20.270
So this is end of if block.

73
04:20.300 --> 04:22.450
Now I have to start else block.

74
04:22.450 --> 04:23.450
So I need not write end here.

75
04:23.470 --> 04:28.320
And here I will write else because it's a part of, continuation of if.

76
04:28.400 --> 04:28.850
Right.

77
04:28.960 --> 04:31.970
If Then Else, else what  I have to do .

78
04:31.970 --> 04:37.840
print Max is y so print Max is y.

79
04:38.710 --> 04:45.180
Then after this say end and so from here if has started and if has ended here.

80
04:45.430 --> 04:47.470
So inside that only Else is also there.

81
04:47.470 --> 04:53.230
So whatever is there before else that comes under if  after else this belonged to the else's block.

82
04:53.800 --> 04:55.700
Then after this there's nothing.

83
04:55.750 --> 04:57.780
end of a program so simply right.

84
04:57.970 --> 05:01.480
end here. that begins and ends here.

85
05:02.200 --> 05:05.040
So this is an algorithm written using pseudocode.

86
05:07.690 --> 05:11.100
So here in this video we learn one thing how to write if.

87
05:11.170 --> 05:11.350
Right.

88
05:11.610 --> 05:14.150
And if you want to put the bracket it's a choice.

89
05:14.740 --> 05:18.610
It's not C++ in C++ we have to be very strict.

90
05:18.890 --> 05:24.340
Now next we will write down a  c++ program for this one so looking at this algorithm I will convert it into a

91
05:24.340 --> 05:25.330
c++ program.

92
05:25.600 --> 05:31.600
So let us start,  here you know that we have to write down hash include then using namespace and the main

93
05:31.660 --> 05:33.760
functions why would you keep it ready.

94
05:33.760 --> 05:34.800
So this is ready.

95
05:34.900 --> 05:40.090
I have made the main function everything is ready now I have to write down this part that is enter two numbers

96
05:40.090 --> 05:40.690
numbers.

97
05:40.690 --> 05:43.010
read numbers and display.

98
05:43.150 --> 05:45.250
So for this I need two variables.

99
05:45.250 --> 05:51.670
So first of all I will declare two variables that is integer X and Y that I should take two number.

100
05:51.670 --> 05:53.380
So for that I should give a message.

101
05:53.380 --> 05:59.830
So for print I should say C out so c out enter two numbers C out enter 2  numbers.

102
05:59.890 --> 06:07.720
The next reading two values cin x and y.

103
06:07.960 --> 06:10.520
Now the important part if and else part.

104
06:10.540 --> 06:14.350
So I will write on here if and else, if X is greater than Y.

105
06:14.380 --> 06:20.640
So watch this how to write it. if  X is greater than y then brackets start.

106
06:20.650 --> 06:30.340
So this is true then I should print that X is a great or maximum is X so c out Max is X Max

107
06:30.430 --> 06:34.870
is and again insertion operation then x.

108
06:34.970 --> 06:38.370
So they move these things.

109
06:38.440 --> 06:52.110
This is for if then else again the end of if block then incidents say C out Max is y.

110
06:52.350 --> 06:56.170
The end of this one say return zero.

111
06:56.350 --> 06:57.910
End of the function.

112
06:57.910 --> 06:59.740
So that's the end of Main function.

113
06:59.770 --> 07:02.740
So this is how a program looks like I'll remove this.

114
07:03.430 --> 07:05.530
So that's all this is the program.

115
07:05.530 --> 07:10.370
So there is a coding exercise available for this one do this coding exercise then after that you will find a

116
07:10.390 --> 07:17.480
demo for this program you can watch the demo and practice this one on your P.C. on your machine do it

117
07:17.500 --> 07:18.300
by yourself.

118
07:18.730 --> 07:20.850
So is the first program on conditional statement.

119
07:21.280 --> 07:25.690
So further in the coming videos will find more and more programs on conditional statements.
