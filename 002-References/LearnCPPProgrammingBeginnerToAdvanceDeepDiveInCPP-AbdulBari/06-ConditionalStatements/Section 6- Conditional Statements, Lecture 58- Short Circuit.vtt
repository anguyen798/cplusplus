Short circuit let us see.

1
00:03.250 --> 00:16.350
See if I'm writing a condition A greater than B and A greater than C, logical oppression used is &.

2
00:16.380 --> 00:21.890
Let us understand what a short circuit see AND will be true if both are true.

3
00:21.900 --> 00:25.030
If anyone is false then entire result is false.

4
00:25.060 --> 00:29.880
Suppose this A is not a greater than B that is a 3 and B is a 5.

5
00:29.940 --> 00:36.440
So this would be false and if this is false this condition will not be checked.

6
00:36.660 --> 00:38.030
That condition will not be checked.

7
00:38.040 --> 00:42.350
So this is called us short circuit and the same way.

8
00:42.420 --> 00:51.170
If I write A greater than B, OR A greater than C, now it is combined with OR, so when OR will be true?

9
00:51.540 --> 00:54.240
if any one of the condition is true then it will be true.

10
00:54.240 --> 00:59.420
So If suppose this is five and this is two and then this condition would be true.

11
00:59.490 --> 01:04.620
And once this is true it will not check this condition because one condition should be true that is

12
01:04.620 --> 01:05.410
sufficient.

13
01:05.430 --> 01:07.460
No it will check the rest if it is checked also.

14
01:07.530 --> 01:08.880
The result is true only.

15
01:10.050 --> 01:16.140
So this mechanism done by the compiler is short circuit.

16
01:16.140 --> 01:24.630
I will take one example and show you if I have three variables  A is five and B is seven and C is three

17
01:30.460 --> 01:32.440
and I is five.

18
01:34.410 --> 01:48.630
If I say if A greater than B and plus plus i less than B. Now let us see, this is five and this is

19
01:48.630 --> 01:49.420
7.

20
01:49.440 --> 01:51.340
So this is false.

21
01:51.390 --> 01:52.280
This is false.

22
01:52.710 --> 01:55.080
So it will not check this condition.

23
01:55.080 --> 02:03.180
after this if I print Cout i then what may be the value of i when this is not performed.

24
02:03.180 --> 02:07.910
So plus plus i will not be done so i remains 5 only and the result will be 5.

25
02:09.290 --> 02:17.270
If suppose A is  15 then it will check this condition 15 greater than 7 Yes.

26
02:17.360 --> 02:23.970
It is true then it comes here and it will also check the condition, so while checking the condition

27
02:23.970 --> 02:25.110
it will perform plus plus.

28
02:25.140 --> 02:30.900
So this becomes six and whatever the result is six is less than seven so it will bring the value of

29
02:30.980 --> 02:31.490
i

30
02:31.590 --> 02:32.900
That is six.

31
02:32.950 --> 02:38.490
So the point here is that in the second part of the conditional statement never use increment or decrement

32
02:38.490 --> 02:41.360
operator  they may get executed or they may not get excecuted
