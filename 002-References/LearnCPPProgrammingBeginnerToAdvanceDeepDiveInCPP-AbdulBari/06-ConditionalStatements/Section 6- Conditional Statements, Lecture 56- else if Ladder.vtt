The topic in this video is else if ladder already in the previous video we have seen nested if.

1
00:06.110 --> 00:09.800
so that extension of that nested if  is else if ladder.

2
00:10.170 --> 00:13.000
So if you have more than one nested if

3
00:13.230 --> 00:19.510
If then nested if is there again it's nesting if is there then it can be easily framed like a else

4
00:19.530 --> 00:20.290
if ladder.

5
00:20.310 --> 00:27.240
That is very easy for writing otherwise but many nested IF will create confusion for a programmer and

6
00:27.240 --> 00:29.610
even the code will not be easily readable.

7
00:30.300 --> 00:33.050
So let us see how you can frame

8
00:33.130 --> 00:37.460
else if ladder for nested if so here is the skeleton given here.

9
00:37.860 --> 00:39.020
Let us see this.

10
00:39.090 --> 00:44.850
This is if condition, if true then, these are the flower bracket something whatever has to be

11
00:44.850 --> 00:46.580
executed should be here.

12
00:46.680 --> 00:48.930
Then else this is the else of this if

13
00:48.930 --> 00:55.060
and inside this else again that is if statement.

14
00:55.200 --> 00:59.980
So then you have if the very first statement as if I said that you can read here also.

15
01:00.090 --> 01:03.900
So actually this is else separate if separate right.

16
01:04.290 --> 01:08.320
So instead of writing it as a nested, I have written it along with else.

17
01:08.340 --> 01:09.990
So yes you can write like this.

18
01:10.110 --> 01:12.120
So that's call as

19
01:12.200 --> 01:14.750
else if ladder. then if,

20
01:16.190 --> 01:17.990
This is the block, and 

21
01:18.100 --> 01:18.790
For this if

22
01:18.800 --> 01:23.880
this is the else,  yes that's what you should know, then this

23
01:23.920 --> 01:25.780
If this is the else,

24
01:25.950 --> 01:27.830
So this else belongs to last

25
01:27.830 --> 01:31.930
If. so if I showed the skeleton for this one it looks like this.

26
01:31.960 --> 01:36.350
If, it's just a rough sketch I'm giving you, then inside that Else is there.

27
01:36.380 --> 01:37.300
This is else.

28
01:37.630 --> 01:43.790
Then again if is there,  then for if, else is there I'm not writing it properly just giving

29
01:43.790 --> 01:44.600
you the skeleton.

30
01:44.620 --> 01:50.420
then inside this again if is there and it's own else is there.

31
01:50.810 --> 01:52.630
So this is how the body.

32
01:52.670 --> 01:57.920
So this is if inside else they again if-else is there, in else again if else is there.

33
01:57.980 --> 02:01.090
So if you write like this it looks very congested.

34
02:01.280 --> 02:02.600
So this is better.

35
02:02.600 --> 02:04.060
This like a ladder.

36
02:04.100 --> 02:06.770
So from here we can climb down down down.

37
02:06.790 --> 02:07.090
so

38
02:07.370 --> 02:09.310
that's why it is called as the 

39
02:09.440 --> 02:10.600
else-if ladder

40
02:11.100 --> 02:14.900
Now let us write a program using this else if ladder.

41
02:15.740 --> 02:17.360
So what is the program, i will explain you.

42
02:17.390 --> 02:25.510
The problem is we will take a day number and will display day name will take a day number and display day

43
02:25.850 --> 02:28.450
name means if day number is one.

44
02:28.490 --> 02:30.770
Then we will say first a day off a week is Sunday right.

45
02:31.120 --> 02:34.290
So Sunday if it is two we will say Tuesday.

46
02:34.340 --> 02:38.970
If it is the three will say Wednesday like that I will write on the program code.

47
02:39.320 --> 02:43.280
So far that already I have main function written here.

48
02:43.290 --> 02:44.910
day variable is already there.

49
02:44.930 --> 02:45.570
Enter day number

50
02:45.590 --> 02:48.790
is there, then reading day, now here

51
02:48.800 --> 02:50.530
I will write down conditional statements.

52
02:50.560 --> 02:51.830
Remove this and write down.

53
02:52.200 --> 03:00.550
If day is equal to one this has to be is exactly equal to one so equal the symbol is use.

54
03:00.710 --> 03:04.100
Then here I will say cout Monday.

55
03:04.220 --> 03:09.440
So in short I will write 'mon' and here endl means go to the next line.

56
03:09.470 --> 03:11.820
So if  at all you require you can write that endl.

57
03:12.220 --> 03:14.290
Otherwise you can skip it.

58
03:14.390 --> 03:17.610
We are going to just play one day right not all days.

59
03:17.670 --> 03:22.930
Then if day is not one, else then what

60
03:23.300 --> 03:32.310
Again if, if day is equal to 2 then here I will print it is Tuesday.

61
03:32.390 --> 03:35.710
So just I will write Tuesday.

62
03:35.890 --> 03:36.720
That's all.

63
03:36.920 --> 03:43.030
endl if you want you write down for the new line then if it is not a two also then else

64
03:43.490 --> 03:55.220
If day is equal to 3 then hear cout wednesday. like this

65
03:55.250 --> 03:56.860
We can go on writing.

66
03:56.900 --> 04:02.610
At last we can write one else because this is continued and at last, last else.

67
04:02.840 --> 04:05.360
Now for 1-7

68
04:05.380 --> 04:09.220
I'll be writing the cases else we can say invalid day no.

69
04:09.380 --> 04:09.980
At last.

70
04:09.980 --> 04:15.830
See this is the I am writing continuation part so continue for three i have written, for four five six seven.

71
04:15.830 --> 04:20.930
All you have to write on then after that cout invalid day

72
04:21.710 --> 04:23.510
So this is the program.

73
04:23.600 --> 04:24.950
One important thing.

74
04:25.760 --> 04:26.920
How it works.

75
04:26.940 --> 04:28.090
That we have to understand.

76
04:28.280 --> 04:32.080
So that will help us to understand the next topic. how it works?

77
04:32.140 --> 04:34.850
Let us see. if I give a day number one.

78
04:35.060 --> 04:37.460
So it will come here and check.

79
04:37.460 --> 04:38.250
It is days 1.

80
04:38.270 --> 04:39.180
Yes true

81
04:39.230 --> 04:40.700
So it will print Monday.

82
04:40.700 --> 04:42.310
So it will not go into this.

83
04:42.380 --> 04:48.470
else means it will not enter into all these things because this is the outermost else all these things

84
04:48.470 --> 04:49.750
are inside this else right.

85
04:50.480 --> 04:52.160
So it will not enter inside.

86
04:52.310 --> 04:53.390
So just check this one.

87
04:53.390 --> 04:54.020
It is true.

88
04:54.020 --> 04:55.970
There is enough.

89
04:55.970 --> 05:01.670
Next if you give the number as three then listen carefully.

90
05:01.880 --> 05:02.830
It will check first.

91
05:02.840 --> 05:04.220
Here you have given three right.

92
05:04.300 --> 05:04.800
Three.

93
05:04.880 --> 05:06.890
Next line is it 3

94
05:06.890 --> 05:08.250
no go to

95
05:08.260 --> 05:08.980
else

96
05:09.200 --> 05:10.130
Is it three.

97
05:10.220 --> 05:10.760
No.

98
05:10.760 --> 05:11.000
goto else

99
05:11.000 --> 05:12.860
is it a three?

100
05:13.190 --> 05:14.220
Yes three.

101
05:14.330 --> 05:16.070
So it will print Wednesday.

102
05:16.160 --> 05:19.370
Then after that it will not go in the remaining else part.

103
05:19.370 --> 05:20.030
For how many.

104
05:20.060 --> 05:24.050
so how many if it has checked, one two three.

105
05:24.050 --> 05:29.830
So after checking three if conditional statements we have found out that is Wednesday.

106
05:30.500 --> 05:32.680
So work is more.

107
05:33.050 --> 05:35.280
So it should directly goto to 3 and say wednesday.

108
05:35.310 --> 05:39.680
No it's not go directly that it will check this one and this one and this one.

109
05:39.680 --> 05:46.180
It means if I gave day number as 7 Yes it will check all seven conditions.

110
05:46.460 --> 05:52.240
If I give invalid number then after checking 7 conditions it will say invalid number.

111
05:52.460 --> 05:53.770
So this is too much.

112
05:53.840 --> 05:56.760
It has to compare make compare a lot of conditions.

113
05:56.870 --> 06:01.370
Yes in this  else if ladder it has to check all the conditions.

114
06:01.370 --> 06:03.730
If your condition is lying at last.

115
06:03.740 --> 06:08.240
So if I say how much time it takes means no. of comparision

116
06:08.240 --> 06:12.520
If your number is bigger than more conditions will be checked.

117
06:12.800 --> 06:18.260
If you get a smaller day number then few conditions will be checked.

118
06:18.480 --> 06:19.150
All right.

119
06:19.460 --> 06:21.410
So this is all we have studied about it.

120
06:21.500 --> 06:24.140
OK so we have seen how it works.

121
06:24.200 --> 06:29.600
So from this we can understand the number of comparisions are dependent on the value that you're giving

122
06:30.430 --> 06:31.300
right.

123
06:31.340 --> 06:33.110
So that's all in this topic.

124
06:33.110 --> 06:39.170
So you can write down this program and you can test it so already there is a demo available and also coding

125
06:39.170 --> 06:39.870
exercise is there for this one

126
06:39.870 --> 06:42.030
for this one for this one.

127
06:42.140 --> 06:44.700
So you have to write on these conditional statements.

128
06:44.710 --> 06:45.030
OK.

129
06:45.050 --> 06:47.420
These conditional statement if all these things.

130
06:47.510 --> 06:50.220
So the same thing you can practice it in coding exercise.

131
06:50.360 --> 06:53.870
And apart from this for other things are also given.

132
06:53.870 --> 06:57.330
So you read question and you read the description of an exercise.

133
06:57.320 --> 06:59.990
You can easily understand it and you solve that one also.

134
07:00.380 --> 07:05.780
So that will give you confidence of writing your own code and for the same you can write on the program

135
07:05.810 --> 07:12.280
by yourself also, then in the next video in the next topic.

136
07:12.370 --> 07:19.540
Will find how is it possible to directly go on day number three without checking these two and directly

137
07:19.540 --> 07:23.400
going on day number four without checking all other conditions.

138
07:23.410 --> 07:28.880
So we will see that we will see a faster method in the upcoming topic.

139
07:28.910 --> 07:30.010
That's all in this video.
