00:02.660 --> 00:07.320
So the previous video we have learned how computer works there I have told you that computer works on

1
00:07.320 --> 00:14.240
binary system that is zeros and ones or on and off but we understand decimal number system.

2
00:14.520 --> 00:20.200
And also I told you that the code so that its numbers can be used codes for giving instruction or

3
00:20.210 --> 00:22.290
data or message.

4
00:22.900 --> 00:28.310
See I'm just going to give the introduction to the number system but there some topic details, how their

5
00:28.320 --> 00:31.950
conversion from octal to binary and so many conversions of it.

6
00:32.520 --> 00:37.710
If you want to learn that it's mostly required in academics if you want to learn that there is a

7
00:37.710 --> 00:43.170
section called miscellaneous you have to go to that section and study in detail about the conversion.

8
00:43.170 --> 00:48.330
So the videos are available there. Here and this video, just I don't want to waste your time I don't want

9
00:48.330 --> 00:49.500
to go in detail right now.

10
00:49.800 --> 00:51.400
So just I'll give you introduction to

11
00:51.420 --> 00:52.090
Number system.

12
00:52.110 --> 00:58.400
So let us look at. See basically we use decimal system in decimal the pictures

13
00:58.500 --> 01:07.760
or figures are symbols are from 0 from 9 total 10 symbols we have. then computer works on

14
01:07.760 --> 01:08.690
zeros and ones.

15
01:08.720 --> 01:10.910
So how many symbols only two symbols.

16
01:11.030 --> 01:17.950
So binary number system have only two symbols 0 and 1 that's all see one thing I'll tell you once

17
01:17.950 --> 01:24.590
we have finished with the last symbol after nine we used a combination of symbols we write .

18
01:24.640 --> 01:30.950
Ten, after that we write 10. 10 means to zero and one we are combining one and zero.

19
01:31.000 --> 01:32.180
So this place has one.

20
01:32.290 --> 01:35.110
The next place again will start from zero one two three.

21
01:35.980 --> 01:37.820
So we have finished with the symbol.

22
01:37.840 --> 01:40.020
So that's why we're taking combination of symbol.

23
01:40.360 --> 01:46.470
So same way we have only o and 1, then what is the next number , it is is 1 0.

24
01:46.480 --> 01:49.510
We have to take the combination.

25
01:49.510 --> 01:53.670
So don't read it as 10, read it as a 1 0 in binary form.

26
01:54.070 --> 01:54.780
That's it.

27
01:54.790 --> 01:56.100
So I have some numbers here.

28
01:56.110 --> 02:04.360
Just look at them zero in binary former 0, 1 is 1, 2 is 1 0, 3 is 1 1, 4 is 1 0 0, 5 is 1 0 1.

29
02:04.360 --> 02:11.280
So on ,up to 16 I have written. if you want to be strong in the concepts of programming you want to

30
02:11.300 --> 02:16.220
study it in detail very minor things you should know these numbers.

31
02:16.510 --> 02:21.460
So some of them you should remember some of them should be quickly able to convert them so that I have

32
02:21.460 --> 02:25.210
explained in miscellaneous videos that you can learn it next.

33
02:25.960 --> 02:26.690
What is this.

34
02:26.770 --> 02:31.590
octa and hexa, remembering a number in 0 0 1 1 1.

35
02:31.630 --> 02:33.400
its too tough

36
02:33.430 --> 02:34.890
We need a simple method.

37
02:34.990 --> 02:42.370
So what people have done to make this a simple octal is introduce so you can take three digits of a

38
02:42.400 --> 02:49.420
binary number and convert it to octal. no even this also less so they have introduced hexadecimal

39
02:49.930 --> 02:54.630
means six plus 10 hexadecimal total 16.

40
02:55.420 --> 02:56.560
So 0 to 9.

41
02:56.710 --> 03:03.750
Then after that for10 English Alphabet A which is used that b c d e f last.

42
03:03.880 --> 03:04.430
So there are

43
03:04.430 --> 03:07.850
Total 16 digits in this one,  figures in this one,

44
03:07.840 --> 03:09.230
symbols in this one.

45
03:09.490 --> 03:16.870
Then after that we take combination 1 0, so how to convert this into this one this to octal

46
03:16.900 --> 03:18.170
binary to hexa

47
03:18.400 --> 03:20.460
Everything is there you can study it.

48
03:20.980 --> 03:26.440
But in this video I'll just show you conversion from the decimal to binary then binary back Back to decimal 

49
03:26.500 --> 03:28.430
just to give you the idea.

50
03:28.480 --> 03:29.890
So let us take an example.

51
03:30.070 --> 03:33.490
I have a number decimal number base 10 means it is decimal number.

52
03:33.520 --> 03:35.440
So this is bas 10 and this is base 8.

53
03:35.440 --> 03:43.030
This is Base 2 and this is base 16 so we write 10 here because 25 can be there in Octal also hexa also

54
03:43.210 --> 03:48.370
which one it is? Now to show that we will say decimal as ten.

55
03:48.400 --> 03:50.440
then how to convert into binary.

56
03:50.440 --> 03:58.620
So the method is we'd find out successively divided by two to get the binary form two ones twoes, two twoes

57
03:58.930 --> 04:11.320
So 2*12=24 reminder is 1, 2* 6=12 reminder is 0 and 2*3=  6 remainder 0, 2 *1=2 remainder 

58
04:11.310 --> 04:12.250
is 1.

59
04:12.390 --> 04:13.800
So we take remainder here.

60
04:13.810 --> 04:18.160
We don't play decimal 2*0 times 0.

61
04:18.260 --> 04:19.330
Remainder is 1.

62
04:19.330 --> 04:21.820
So take the digits from bottom to up.

63
04:21.910 --> 04:27.220
So the digit side 1 1 0 0 1--- 1 1 0 0 1.

64
04:27.220 --> 04:34.840
This is the binary form. so this is how a decimal number is converted into binary. Then a binary back

65
04:34.840 --> 04:35.910
to the decimal.

66
04:35.920 --> 04:37.630
Let us see the procedure.

67
04:37.630 --> 04:45.020
If I take the same number and convert into decimal form so take the number in the boxes one two

68
04:45.050 --> 04:46.030
three four five.

69
04:46.360 --> 04:49.450
So I need five boxes.

70
04:49.450 --> 04:50.550
Then write this number.

71
04:50.550 --> 04:53.530
1 1 0 0 1.

72
04:53.660 --> 05:01.650
Then, at this bottom, write from right side 2 power 0, 2 power 1, 2 power 2, two power 3, 2 power 4

73
05:01.750 --> 05:02.970
4.

74
05:03.850 --> 05:13.750
Now 1 * 2^4 + 1*2^3 +0*2^2+0*2^1+1*2^0

75
05:13.750 --> 05:16.020
...

76
05:16.060 --> 05:20.330
This is how much 16 + 8

77
05:20.410 --> 05:25.360
+0, (multiplied by anything is 0 only 0 multiplied by anything is 0)

78
05:25.360 --> 05:30.400
This is 1 for how many this is twenty four plus 1 So this is twenty five.

79
05:30.400 --> 05:32.070
So we got this in twenty five.

80
05:32.070 --> 05:34.700
That is no. system decimal system.

81
05:35.080 --> 05:36.840
So this how the conversion is done.

82
05:37.240 --> 05:37.930
So that's it.

83
05:37.930 --> 05:39.310
This is sufficient.

84
05:39.310 --> 05:45.010
I have shown you the decimal number in binary and binary back to decimal so like this procedure are

85
05:45.010 --> 05:48.610
used for converting them using pen and paper.

86
05:48.610 --> 05:54.290
Now electronic circuitry internally handle these things. right? For humans.

87
05:54.340 --> 05:58.990
We follow this conversion methods to understand how it is represented in binary form.

88
05:59.560 --> 06:03.640
So knowing no. system will definitely help you right.

89
06:03.790 --> 06:08.830
Give you detailed understanding but associated with some other subjects are also there.

90
06:08.860 --> 06:11.400
So in other subjects it will be very helpful.

91
06:11.540 --> 06:12.130
Right.

92
06:12.310 --> 06:13.860
That's all about no system.

93
06:13.960 --> 06:17.360
See the coming video based on the concept only right.

94
06:17.600 --> 06:20.510
So you have to be calm and follow each and every video.

95
06:20.510 --> 06:24.970
If you are beginner then don't skip any video right.

96
06:24.980 --> 06:29.870
I'm not going to directly start showing you how to write on the program. first you should have some

97
06:29.870 --> 06:30.520
basics.

98
06:30.560 --> 06:35.570
If you're learning programming for the first time study all these, watch all this video and you will be

99
06:35.570 --> 06:37.700
prepared for understanding programming.

100
06:38.130 --> 06:38.870
All right.

101
06:39.860 --> 06:40.940
So watch the next video.
