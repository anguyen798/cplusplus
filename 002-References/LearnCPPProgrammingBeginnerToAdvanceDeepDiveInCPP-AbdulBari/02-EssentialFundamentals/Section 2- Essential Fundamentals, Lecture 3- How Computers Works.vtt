00:01.320 --> 00:05.350
For understanding how computers works 
first of all let us look at a Block diagram

1
00:05.380 --> 00:06.990
It's a very basic thing.

2
00:06.990 --> 00:08.330
Let us study it.

3
00:08.580 --> 00:10.610
See there's a blog them off your computer.

4
00:11.830 --> 00:13.680
Let us see the components first of all.

5
00:13.680 --> 00:20.830
See this the CPU, it is having two parts ALU i.e,arthimatic and logical veiw

6
00:20.880 --> 00:21.780
and control unit, CU

7
00:21.870 --> 00:28.080
I'll explain they're working. The next is main memory and this is the hard disk drive which contains

8
00:28.080 --> 00:36.780
the data in the form of files and this is input device like a keyboard mouse or a stylus tablet anything

9
00:37.380 --> 00:42.890
then the output device like your monitor or printer and speakers.

10
00:42.990 --> 00:49.860
Now let us understand that working see the heart of the computer is the CPU that is central processing

11
00:49.860 --> 00:58.890
unit or micro processor if you present day processor if you see that is i3, i5 ,i7 these processors.

12
00:58.890 --> 01:05.280
Now this part processor will have two parts that is arthimatical and logical unit and control unit.

13
01:05.280 --> 01:12.690
So what is that? arthimatical and logical unit can perform arthimatical and logical operations a basic

14
01:12.690 --> 01:20.610
operation so a computer can perform basic operations like arthimatic operations like addition subtraction

15
01:20.610 --> 01:29.070
multiplication or division or modulus then under logical operations it can compare two numbers we can

16
01:29.070 --> 01:38.850
compare less then greater than or equal to and also it can perform logical operations AND OR these operations

17
01:38.850 --> 01:44.250
like this written in caps so AND and OR as well as NOT.

18
01:45.450 --> 01:47.920
So these are the logical operations basically.

19
01:48.180 --> 01:53.510
So it can perform just these basic operations right then.

20
01:53.520 --> 02:00.150
Second is CU control unit C there are other things connected like Hard Disk Drive and the main memory

21
02:00.150 --> 02:03.180
input device and an output device for controlling all these things.

22
02:03.180 --> 02:09.990
Controlling means utilizing them so for that it is having a separate portion that is called control

23
02:09.990 --> 02:10.430
unit.

24
02:10.800 --> 02:15.640
So its job is to utilize other resources.

25
02:15.640 --> 02:18.170
This is about processor now.

26
02:18.190 --> 02:20.410
Next thing let us start from here.

27
02:20.410 --> 02:26.850
This is hard disk hard disk will contain files and those files maybe two types.

28
02:26.920 --> 02:38.290
Either program files or data files like if you take a example a notepad on your P.C. is a program

29
02:38.290 --> 02:39.880
file when you open notepad.

30
02:39.880 --> 02:40.690
It's a program.

31
02:40.720 --> 02:42.280
So there is a file available

32
02:42.310 --> 02:45.450
Basically we click on some icon and then the program will start.

33
02:45.580 --> 02:52.390
But if you look into my computers and folders and some where you will find a program for notepad and

34
02:52.390 --> 02:55.900
its name file name will be notepad.exe

35
02:55.980 --> 03:05.470
if you search for It you can find this file there's a program file Now inside notpad if you type something

36
03:05.560 --> 03:11.920
and save then it will be saving it as a text file so you may be saving as my.txt file

37
03:12.070 --> 03:13.200
right

38
03:13.750 --> 03:17.460
So this is a program file and this is a data file.

39
03:17.890 --> 03:22.740
This data file is used by notepad or generated by notepad.

40
03:22.810 --> 03:28.760
So finally hard disk contains two types of files program files and data files.

41
03:28.780 --> 03:36.370
If you have audio files or music files or video files all those comes under the data files and if you have

42
03:36.370 --> 03:42.070
a music player like VLC player or media player those come under the program files.

43
03:42.610 --> 03:49.850
So we save our programs kept inside hard disk and that is permenant storage this will be larger in size.

44
03:49.900 --> 03:57.640
The next if suppose we want to run any program then that program should be present inside the main memory

45
03:57.670 --> 03:59.350
so that CPU can execute it.

46
04:00.100 --> 04:04.630
So the program is brought from the hard disk to the main memory.

47
04:04.630 --> 04:07.540
It is brought from hard disk to the main memory.

48
04:07.540 --> 04:10.160
So this is a working memory.

49
04:10.190 --> 04:13.790
Our primary memory or work space.

50
04:14.110 --> 04:16.080
So programs should be brought here.

51
04:16.120 --> 04:20.430
Then CPU can execute the program by taking instructions.

52
04:20.440 --> 04:27.880
Line by line for whatever the programs we run they are brought here inside the main memory right.

53
04:27.930 --> 04:34.930
Then if a program needs to some data from keyboard or it has to display something on the monitor then

54
04:34.930 --> 04:38.160
it can utilize this input devices or output devices.

55
04:38.290 --> 04:43.680
So the program may be taking something from keyboard or remember taking something from Internet or maybe

56
04:43.720 --> 04:45.350
reading something from the file.

57
04:45.430 --> 04:48.920
So if program needs to some data it would be getting it from here.

58
04:49.000 --> 04:54.400
Whatever the result is generated by the program or interactivity provided by a program that you can

59
04:54.400 --> 05:01.510
find it on the output device like monitor or if any output for it is printed on the printer and these

60
05:01.600 --> 05:07.000
input and output devices are connected to the system and they have the own memory like I'm sure you'd

61
05:07.000 --> 05:07.540
like this.

62
05:07.540 --> 05:12.810
This is the memory belongs to input device and this memory belongs to the output device.

63
05:12.880 --> 05:17.710
So this I will call it as input buffer this is a buffer.

64
05:17.710 --> 05:22.870
this the memory and similarly that is output buffer this is output buffer.

65
05:23.920 --> 05:30.550
So if a program has to read something from the keyboard so it will go to memory area and get the data

66
05:30.550 --> 05:31.280
from there.

67
05:31.510 --> 05:36.730
I think it has to be something on the monitor then whatever it has to print it will put it in its memory

68
05:36.730 --> 05:39.400
area called s buffer, output buffer.

69
05:39.610 --> 05:45.070
It's not that program directly go and print something on the monitor it will dumb everything inside

70
05:45.070 --> 05:48.630
the frame that is the frame buffer or output buffer.

71
05:48.970 --> 05:55.450
And that will appear on the screen now same way whatever typing from the keyboard that will go and fall

72
05:55.510 --> 05:58.500
inside the buffer it directly doesn't enter into the program.

73
05:58.630 --> 06:04.350
It will go on and fall into the buffer and the program can read the contents from the buffer so there's

74
06:04.370 --> 06:11.260
a communication point for the device and a program running inside the in memory now.

75
06:11.840 --> 06:12.420
So that's it.

76
06:12.490 --> 06:16.100
One of the important thing we have understood how they work altogether.

77
06:16.130 --> 06:18.880
So once again I repeat quickly the programs are here.

78
06:18.890 --> 06:24.220
They have to be brought into the main memory for execution and CPU will execute them by executing instructions

79
06:24.230 --> 06:25.160
line by line.

80
06:25.160 --> 06:31.070
And if program requests for interactive interact with the user and users input and output devices.

81
06:31.430 --> 06:36.400
Now we will learn how that CQ works how that works.

82
06:36.410 --> 06:40.440
How it understand what does it mean by instruction how can it understand instruction.

83
06:40.550 --> 06:43.140
So for this let us start from the basics.

84
06:43.520 --> 06:46.900
See computer works on the binary number system.

85
06:47.000 --> 06:52.090
What is binary system. why it  works on binary system, see it's an electronic device.

86
06:52.190 --> 06:54.880
So it works on current or voltages

87
06:55.070 --> 06:59.650
so voltages are trickally or logically used as a binary.

88
07:00.020 --> 07:07.670
How, a low level voltage is taken as zero and high voltage is treated as one.

89
07:08.810 --> 07:19.520
So it is just like if suppose you have a bulb, this a bulb right, this bulb can be OFF or a bulb can be

90
07:19.730 --> 07:28.360
either ON, if it is ON then we treat it as one if it is OFF we treat it as zero, that's all. 

91
07:29.370 --> 07:34.080
Now if you have seen electronic circuitry like I/C, I will draw it here.

92
07:35.250 --> 07:41.060
If you look at the electronic circuitry like this an I/C, right integrated circuit.

93
07:41.070 --> 07:42.330
It is also called as a chip.

94
07:42.330 --> 07:48.300
You can see the photograph also, here I have taken the same example.

95
07:48.300 --> 07:55.830
Now just on the integrated circuit it is having pins here, these are pins this is electronic right now.

96
07:55.840 --> 07:59.200
Through out these pins we can pass some voltages right.

97
07:59.240 --> 08:00.200
Some voltage. 

98
08:00.200 --> 08:06.610
So in this one particular pin we can pass either low voltage or we can pass high voltage. Low voltage

99
08:06.620 --> 08:09.320
means zero and a high voltage is one.

100
08:09.320 --> 08:14.660
Now this it maybe taking in and storing it or it maybe moving it sending it out through this other pin the

101
08:14.660 --> 08:20.360
other end for how it works and all we don't have to go in detail just we have to focus on binary form

102
08:20.450 --> 08:21.360
right.

103
08:21.380 --> 08:25.570
So this one pin can be can be either zero or one.

104
08:26.120 --> 08:26.690
Right.

105
08:26.750 --> 08:28.490
So only two possibilities are there.

106
08:28.520 --> 08:30.230
So that's how this is binary.

107
08:30.230 --> 08:37.120
So we say does that binary number system and we call this as one bit, we call it -- one bit.

108
08:37.340 --> 08:38.170
So this is.

109
08:38.230 --> 08:44.580
bit. Then if I count one two three four five six seven eight eight bits are there.

110
08:44.630 --> 08:50.970
So this together 8 bit, we call it as one byte. So 8 binary bits.

111
08:51.080 --> 08:55.000
Now all of these bits are zeros means with the low voltage

112
08:55.010 --> 09:03.030
So this is 0 0 0 0, this is 0 or all those eight bits are zero but only the last bit is one.

113
09:03.050 --> 09:07.750
So this will be like this or some are zeros and some are ones.

114
09:07.790 --> 09:08.220
Right.

115
09:08.240 --> 09:14.570
So there can be many combinations now eight bits together.

116
09:14.750 --> 09:16.870
These are forming this pattern.

117
09:16.880 --> 09:24.620
They can form various backgrounds now each pattern of bits we can take it as an instruction. 

118
09:24.620 --> 09:30.470
Pattern of bits of that is in binary form and we can take it as an instruction how it is treated as instruction

119
09:30.480 --> 09:36.830
I'll explain I'll remove this and explain you. See if there is one bulb then that a bulb can be either

120
09:36.920 --> 09:39.050
on or off.

121
09:39.040 --> 09:44.210
Now if you look at traffic signals and if you consider only one bulb there usually will have three different

122
09:44.210 --> 09:44.960
lights.

123
09:44.960 --> 09:47.020
Let us assume there is only one bulb.

124
09:47.240 --> 09:49.570
that bulb is for only two things.

125
09:49.610 --> 09:51.460
It can be used only for two things.

126
09:51.570 --> 09:57.310
The bulb is off means you should stop or it is on means you can go. or in other way

127
09:57.330 --> 10:01.660
If you say no, no if it is on means you should stop and off means you should go.

128
10:01.770 --> 10:03.180
Whatever it is ,whatever you like.

129
10:03.180 --> 10:08.400
You can set it so we can set the rule and you can communicate with the people that this will be the

130
10:08.400 --> 10:09.020
code 

131
10:09.020 --> 10:10.150
That will be followed.

132
10:10.580 --> 10:11.860
There will be only one bulb.

133
10:11.910 --> 10:14.480
And if it is on means you can go.

134
10:14.510 --> 10:15.300
It is off means

135
10:15.300 --> 10:23.120
You should stop. Like this we can use this type of codes at many places like suppose Oh Officer

136
10:23.150 --> 10:24.390
is there in his office.

137
10:24.390 --> 10:26.310
So bulbs on means he's there.

138
10:26.310 --> 10:31.300
If it is off he's not there. right? or if a shop is there.

139
10:31.330 --> 10:34.780
Bulbs is on means shop is open. If bulb is off then

140
10:34.780 --> 10:35.980
Shop is closed.

141
10:36.160 --> 10:36.750
Like this.

142
10:36.880 --> 10:39.510
This gives some message this gives the codes so.

143
10:39.550 --> 10:40.720
Same thing.

144
10:40.720 --> 10:46.530
Electronic circuitry is having voltages zeroes or ones means on and off using these voltages.

145
10:46.660 --> 10:48.930
we can make some communication.

146
10:49.030 --> 10:52.110
So one bulb can give you two messages right.

147
10:52.230 --> 10:52.690
Go.

148
10:52.690 --> 10:56.090
Or stop shop is open or closed like that.

149
10:56.260 --> 10:57.570
If you increase the bulbs.

150
10:57.670 --> 11:03.970
So let us take two bulbs if you have two bulbs then what are the combinations possible with the two

151
11:03.970 --> 11:06.390
bulbs both the bulbs are off.

152
11:06.430 --> 11:07.060
Right.

153
11:07.090 --> 11:09.280
or these bulbs on.

154
11:09.370 --> 11:12.900
or this bulbs on or both are on. so it means

155
11:12.910 --> 11:19.990
This is giving four different messages, four different messages two bulbs can give you together four different

156
11:19.990 --> 11:20.560
messages.

157
11:20.860 --> 11:26.050
So if you have to communicate four things with the people then you can have two bulbs and you can set

158
11:26.050 --> 11:30.270
them on and off and you should already educate the people and say that this means this.

159
11:30.280 --> 11:35.890
This means that and so and so. like example in an examination if it's a multiple choice question paper.

160
11:35.920 --> 11:38.020
Now students want to copy them.

161
11:38.020 --> 11:43.940
Now if one of the person knows the answer so he can communicate to others for that they already said the codes.

162
11:43.960 --> 11:50.720
Like if I scratch here it means option A, if I do it like this, rub my eyes, then it is option B.

163
11:50.950 --> 11:55.600
Like that they can set the codes beforehand they set the codes and they can understand it in the examination

164
11:55.600 --> 11:55.900
hall.

165
11:56.350 --> 11:58.020
So same thing.

166
11:58.050 --> 12:01.860
Now similarly we can use two bulbs for giving more messages.

167
12:01.870 --> 12:11.020
So if there are three bulbs then what, if there are three bulbs just unscrambling so 0 0 0 people

168
12:11.020 --> 12:12.270
how many possibilities are there.

169
12:12.280 --> 12:16.990
So this is two power three eight possibilities are out there right.

170
12:17.350 --> 12:19.480
So it means what about four bulbs.

171
12:19.540 --> 12:24.640
If you have have four bolts then this is two power four sixteen.

172
12:24.730 --> 12:27.390
And what if we have eight bulbs.

173
12:27.520 --> 12:35.710
So eight bulbs will be two power eight that that is 256 so we can have different 256 different commands

174
12:36.070 --> 12:40.450
two fifty six different messages messages.

175
12:40.510 --> 12:41.790
So that's it.

176
12:41.800 --> 12:44.860
So the computer system works on binary number system.

177
12:44.980 --> 12:47.100
This bulbs are nothing but the pins.

178
12:47.190 --> 12:54.160
And If suppose there are eight pins like this on I/C so it is just eight now each pin you assume

179
12:54.160 --> 12:55.170
that it's a bulb.

180
12:55.300 --> 13:01.210
And that can be on and off total eight pins can have different commands like 256 different commands.

181
13:01.300 --> 13:03.430
So messages are commands.

182
13:03.530 --> 13:11.700
So in the same way this CPU was also built up on messages that are in the form of binary that is low voltage

183
13:11.700 --> 13:14.720
or high voltage that is on and off.

184
13:14.800 --> 13:15.960
We'll see more on this one.

185
13:15.970 --> 13:22.150
I'll remove this and discuss further. So now that we can say that the language of computers is binary they

186
13:22.150 --> 13:26.620
understand binary language that is in the form of zeros and ones that is low voltage or high voltage.

187
13:27.010 --> 13:32.710
So all the instructions and the data everything should be in the form of binary so of language of

188
13:32.710 --> 13:39.720
the CPU is binary so how it perform arithmetic and logical operation it performs operation on binary number

189
13:39.730 --> 13:41.320
system.

190
13:41.590 --> 13:47.320
So that I can see that the language of machine or the computer is binary but we understand the decimal

191
13:47.320 --> 13:48.430
number system.

192
13:48.430 --> 13:53.580
We are not comfortable with binary  number system we preffer working in the decimal number system.

193
13:53.620 --> 13:57.750
So in combination with the decimal number system How it is equal to binary form.

194
13:57.750 --> 13:59.470
Let us look at it a little bit.

195
13:59.500 --> 14:04.270
See in decimal number system we have the digits from 0 1 2 3.

196
14:04.270 --> 14:10.930
So on to 9 we use these digits to form a number but then in the binary number system there are only two numbers

197
14:10.960 --> 14:12.470
that are zeros and ones.

198
14:12.580 --> 14:16.540
So anything we want we want to understand in the form of decimal.

199
14:16.540 --> 14:22.390
So in decimal form if it is zero then it is binary also zero if it is one then it is also one then

200
14:22.390 --> 14:33.270
in decimal it is two when in binary it is 1 2 and 3 is one 1 1, 4 is  1 0 0 ,5 is 1 0 1 and so on.

201
14:33.700 --> 14:40.300
So this is the binary form of these decimal numbers not based on decimal number system we understand

202
14:40.300 --> 14:50.200
that this CPU You or the arithmatical and logical unit perform operations so ignores the instructions

203
14:50.530 --> 15:02.830
ignores commands like zero means add suppose like assume that zero means add the two numbers one means

204
15:02.890 --> 15:10.450
subtract two numbers two means multiply them like this they are forming instructions so there are some

205
15:10.930 --> 15:16.480
predefined instructions that are there inside that circuitry electronic circuitry and that is logically

206
15:16.480 --> 15:22.150
designed to work on commands. so the commands that we already know we have seen that it can perform arithmatic

207
15:22.150 --> 15:28.360
and logical operations those operations are given in the form of codes and it already knows that which

208
15:28.420 --> 15:35.200
command means what I have to do and we write the programs in the form of binary so the programs must be present

209
15:35.200 --> 15:40.480
inside the main memory in the form of binary so each line of program that is an instruction it will

210
15:40.510 --> 15:46.540
CPU will take an instruction and execute it because it already knows what it has to do for which code.

211
15:46.780 --> 15:52.580
For like these becomes the codes as instructions for performing specific instruction.

212
15:52.750 --> 15:58.660
So if you study some machine language or low level language of computer system you can understand that

213
15:59.020 --> 16:02.320
its instructions are in the form of binary right.

214
16:02.800 --> 16:04.880
So that's all we end here.

215
16:04.960 --> 16:11.120
The conclusion of the talk is how computer works computer works on binary number system right.

216
16:11.140 --> 16:16.300
And why they work on binary system because they are based on electronic and in electronic signal are

217
16:16.300 --> 16:19.000
either zero or one that is low or high.

218
16:19.030 --> 16:21.900
So that how everything is built up on binary.

219
16:22.030 --> 16:28.330
If we don't understand binary number system so to know how it is related to a decimal system we should

220
16:28.330 --> 16:33.310
understand some number systems in the next video we will discuss about number systems.
