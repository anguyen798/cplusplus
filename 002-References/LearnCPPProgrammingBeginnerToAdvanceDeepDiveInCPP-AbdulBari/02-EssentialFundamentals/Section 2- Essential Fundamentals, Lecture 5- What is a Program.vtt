00:00.510 --> 00:07.380
And this video I'm going to discuss what does it mean by a program, why we write program  and how it is possible

1
00:07.380 --> 00:08.480
to write a program.

2
00:08.520 --> 00:11.130
So we learn about these basic things.

3
00:11.460 --> 00:16.950
See in the previous videos already we have discovered that our computers can understand binary form

4
00:16.950 --> 00:17.720
of language.

5
00:18.120 --> 00:22.530
So there are some predefined set of instructions that a processor or

6
00:22.560 --> 00:23.700
CPU can understand.

7
00:23.880 --> 00:28.290
And we have to use those instructions for performing a task.

8
00:28.320 --> 00:29.880
Now what does it mean by task here.

9
00:30.300 --> 00:31.680
So let us understand why.

10
00:31.680 --> 00:33.180
Actually we need computers.

11
00:33.180 --> 00:35.620
What is the purpose of using computers.

12
00:35.640 --> 00:40.020
We use computers for performing computational task.

13
00:40.020 --> 00:41.900
So what does this computational task.

14
00:42.300 --> 00:45.240
All those tasks which are done using pen and paper.

15
00:45.290 --> 00:52.500
The computations by using formulas by using any expression we put the values and get answers so we use

16
00:52.500 --> 00:55.170
various formula,  various steps.

17
00:55.170 --> 00:58.610
So computation work that is paper work.

18
00:58.670 --> 01:01.760
So for that purpose we use computers.

19
01:02.400 --> 01:05.430
So that computation work can also be done using calculator.

20
01:05.880 --> 01:07.980
Yes it can be done using calculator.

21
01:08.400 --> 01:11.530
So let us understand first how do you use a calculator.

22
01:11.530 --> 01:15.560
And then I'll show you how we can use computers and what does it mean programming.

23
01:15.840 --> 01:17.400
We use calculator like this.

24
01:17.430 --> 01:20.940
See for example if I have two numbers I want to add them.

25
01:20.940 --> 01:22.540
First  no. is 13,

26
01:22.740 --> 01:24.670
And second no. is 27.

27
01:24.670 --> 01:25.970
I want to add them.

28
01:25.980 --> 01:32.580
So pick a calculator hit first number 13 and then press plus then hit second number 27.

29
01:32.730 --> 01:34.260
Then press equal to sign,

30
01:34.350 --> 01:37.100
So I'm pressing plus sign and equal to sign.

31
01:37.110 --> 01:43.120
And finally I get the answer that is 40 so you can use a calculator for adding two numbers.

32
01:43.230 --> 01:47.670
A simple task so I don't need a computer for this one.

33
01:47.810 --> 01:55.830
That next if I have a list of numbers and I want to calculate average of those numbers.

34
01:55.840 --> 02:06.280
So I'll just write on few numbers here 10 15 8 6 9 5 12 13.

35
02:06.760 --> 02:09.870
So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8.

36
02:09.940 --> 02:13.020
I'm adding more numbers eleven and sixteen.

37
02:13.360 --> 02:15.140
So I have to order 10 numbers.

38
02:15.220 --> 02:17.880
I want to find average of these numbers.

39
02:18.040 --> 02:20.490
Then how to use a calculator.

40
02:20.530 --> 02:21.550
Now watch it.

41
02:21.580 --> 02:24.400
I have to enter or hit 1 0 for the first number.

42
02:24.670 --> 02:28.720
Then + then next number then plus the next number plus next number.

43
02:28.870 --> 02:32.830
I have to go on adding them and that's something to be getting accumulated.

44
02:33.250 --> 02:40.900
So finally I'll get the total of all these numbers like total is one not five for these numbers then

45
02:41.410 --> 02:46.860
I should also have the count of numbers, total how many numbers I have? total 10 no. i have

46
02:46.860 --> 02:55.600
that total I should divided by ten then, I get that as ten point five here calculator doesn't

47
02:55.600 --> 02:59.820
know how to find the average I should know how to find the average.

48
02:59.830 --> 03:04.780
So far finding an average I should have the list of numbers on I should go on adding them and then they

49
03:04.780 --> 03:08.350
should divide them by a number of numbers and that is 10.

50
03:08.350 --> 03:10.770
Then i get the result right.

51
03:10.780 --> 03:13.320
This is not a simple operation.

52
03:13.330 --> 03:15.190
This was a simple operation.

53
03:15.220 --> 03:17.110
This is having a procedure.

54
03:17.140 --> 03:20.680
Yes there is a procedure for finding average.

55
03:20.710 --> 03:26.770
Now similarly there is a procedure for finding the maximum number or the total number of numbers.

56
03:26.770 --> 03:29.260
There is a procedure for searching a particular number.

57
03:29.260 --> 03:30.270
In this list.

58
03:30.450 --> 03:34.000
So for various things there are some procedures.

59
03:34.010 --> 03:39.520
And if you have learned about statistics then I want to find a mean of these numbers or median of these

60
03:39.520 --> 03:39.880
numbers.

61
03:39.880 --> 03:41.210
So there is a procedure for that.

62
03:41.350 --> 03:47.310
If you want to sort these numbers then there is a procedure so calculator doesn't know the procedure

63
03:47.350 --> 03:51.430
means that the steps involve for completing a particular task.

64
03:51.520 --> 03:53.580
now how we know it.

65
03:53.680 --> 03:56.190
Our teachers have taught us that procedure.

66
03:56.200 --> 03:58.800
So we know the procedure right.

67
03:58.870 --> 04:04.330
So same procedure can we teach it to calculate that itself so that just we will tell.

68
04:04.330 --> 04:05.760
We want average.

69
04:05.770 --> 04:07.420
It should ask what are the numbers.

70
04:07.420 --> 04:11.770
These are the numbers. and it  should give us the result without asking us how to do it.

71
04:11.770 --> 04:15.410
We want our calculator to be trained on this one.

72
04:15.490 --> 04:20.050
So it means we want our programmable calculator.

73
04:20.710 --> 04:22.680
Yes that's it.

74
04:22.690 --> 04:28.150
So the extension of calculator I can see on the next level to calculate there is nothing but computer.

75
04:28.150 --> 04:32.590
Computer is a programmable computational device.

76
04:32.590 --> 04:39.020
We can define a procedure by giving all the steps one by one to our computer system and we call it as

77
04:39.040 --> 04:44.830
a program and the program a computer system or a CPU or processor will execute those set of instructions

78
04:45.160 --> 04:46.180
and give us the result.

79
04:46.960 --> 04:50.990
So that's what is programming that's it.

80
04:51.040 --> 04:54.550
This is what we use computers and what is programming.

81
04:54.550 --> 04:59.740
I have told you no more about program more detail and clear picture about a program.

82
04:59.740 --> 05:02.590
I will give you my take on a list of numbers.

83
05:02.650 --> 05:04.110
So these are the list of numbers.

84
05:04.270 --> 05:05.660
Let us say the procedure the same.

85
05:05.680 --> 05:07.250
I want to find an average.

86
05:07.330 --> 05:08.710
So what are these numbers.

87
05:08.710 --> 05:11.440
These numbers are nothing but data.

88
05:11.440 --> 05:16.190
This is a data. then for performing average.

89
05:16.270 --> 05:18.060
There is a procedure right.

90
05:18.100 --> 05:19.300
So that procedure.

91
05:19.300 --> 05:21.450
The steps involved in that one.

92
05:21.490 --> 05:29.100
So those are nothing but instructions so he can say these are instructions right.

93
05:29.140 --> 05:34.060
So there are two things now data and instructions upon that data.

94
05:34.450 --> 05:42.130
So program is nothing but collection of data and a set of operations or instructions on that data.

95
05:42.610 --> 05:45.880
So we have to focus on only two things in our programs.

96
05:45.880 --> 05:48.250
What is the data you have and what you do want.

97
05:48.250 --> 05:49.810
What you want to do with that data.

98
05:50.080 --> 05:51.370
So what are the steps.

99
05:51.370 --> 05:52.540
What is the procedure.

100
05:52.540 --> 05:53.430
See without data

101
05:53.440 --> 05:57.110
There is no need of instructions like instructions are useless.

102
05:57.220 --> 06:00.910
And if you have just the data more instruction than you don't know the results right.

103
06:01.210 --> 06:03.370
So these are the two important parts of a program.

104
06:03.670 --> 06:05.080
So we have to focus on this one.

105
06:05.740 --> 06:11.620
We have to learn how to represent our data and also we have to learn how to write on the instructions

106
06:12.070 --> 06:15.160
that will execute our computer data to get that answer.

107
06:15.190 --> 06:17.760
So this was a learning programming.

108
06:17.800 --> 06:24.160
Now one important thing for learning programming you should already know the procedure right.

109
06:24.190 --> 06:28.590
This is the very very very important point here that most of the students get confused.

110
06:28.600 --> 06:35.030
The thing that learning programming will make them learn procedure no learning procedures are different.

111
06:35.320 --> 06:37.300
writing programs is different.

112
06:37.300 --> 06:42.950
So we are going to learn two things how to write a program and how to write what a procedure right.

113
06:42.970 --> 06:45.010
How to convert procedure into a program.

114
06:45.460 --> 06:48.910
So a program contains a data and a set of instructions.

115
06:48.910 --> 06:51.220
Now let us come to the computer site.

116
06:51.260 --> 06:54.670
See this is all a machine computer machine right.

117
06:54.670 --> 07:04.700
So let us say it is a CPU now this is my self, now language of CPU zeroes and ones.(binary)

118
07:04.900 --> 07:09.880
How to represent data in that one? In the form of zeros and ones.

119
07:09.880 --> 07:11.920
How do you present instructions.

120
07:12.010 --> 07:17.520
That is also in the form of zeros and ones both the data as well as instructions are in the form of

121
07:17.540 --> 07:19.440
zeros and ones that is binary.

122
07:19.570 --> 07:21.790
Then what is my language.

123
07:21.790 --> 07:29.560
My language is English language so instructions are in English and our data is also English.

124
07:29.560 --> 07:36.430
Like if I if you asked me to read these numbers I would say 10 15 9 6 8 this is English, numbers are

125
07:36.430 --> 07:37.210
also in English.

126
07:37.540 --> 07:42.040
If you know any other language then these numbers are called by different word or different

127
07:42.040 --> 07:44.980
names are there for them and the figures are also different.

128
07:45.160 --> 07:47.170
So this is English.

129
07:47.170 --> 07:52.990
So my data is also English and the instructions are also in English and CPU language  is machine

130
07:52.990 --> 07:55.060
language is zeros and ones.

131
07:55.060 --> 07:56.000
This is binary.

132
07:56.170 --> 08:02.500
This is machine language and this is natural language that is human being's language.

133
08:02.500 --> 08:11.080
Now we want our machine to learn our procedures so we have to learn in a machine language or we should

134
08:11.080 --> 08:17.230
develop our machines so that they understand natural language anyone of this right now.

135
08:17.230 --> 08:22.630
Either way it's not possible either way it's not possible we can't run machine language and computers

136
08:22.630 --> 08:27.280
are not so much developed that they understand natural language no recent computers they are having

137
08:27.280 --> 08:32.800
some artificial intelligence that are useful for pulling the data but not for programming it. for

138
08:32.800 --> 08:39.040
programming it machine should understand natural language so this is not yet happening right then what

139
08:39.040 --> 08:45.030
we need now we need some intermediate language so that's easy for me on so easy for machine also.

140
08:45.040 --> 08:51.940
So that's what Here comes programming languages the programming languages that we use like C C++ Java

141
08:51.970 --> 08:58.040
C sharp VB Python all these languages become under programming languages.

142
08:58.180 --> 09:03.370
So we learn this language and whatever procedure are we transform them in this form

143
09:03.730 --> 09:09.340
and these languages will help us to transform that procedure into machine language.

144
09:09.340 --> 09:14.940
So from natural language to programming language and programming language to machine language translation

145
09:14.940 --> 09:15.620
is a time.

146
09:15.770 --> 09:17.410
So this translation is not there.

147
09:17.420 --> 09:19.370
We learn it, we have to learn it right.

148
09:19.510 --> 09:25.300
If translation is available then anybody can do programming just you say it will become a program.

149
09:26.110 --> 09:30.700
So we have to learn a programming language and write our procedures in that language.

150
09:30.700 --> 09:35.170
Then from this language there is something called compiler or interpreter.

151
09:35.260 --> 09:35.620
Right.

152
09:35.700 --> 09:41.410
I'll just write in short we are going to learn that in this next video compiler interpreter will translate

153
09:41.470 --> 09:43.360
that into machine language.

154
09:43.900 --> 09:47.630
So this is how programming languages are useful for writing programs.

155
09:47.680 --> 09:53.140
So we should learn some programming language so that's all about what does it mean by program and why

156
09:53.140 --> 09:54.430
you need programming.

157
09:54.430 --> 09:56.930
Let us revise things very quickly.

158
09:57.150 --> 10:00.650
So you started with a calculator calculator if not a programable device.

159
10:00.680 --> 10:03.490
Now we want our machines to know the procedure.

160
10:03.580 --> 10:06.580
Just want given the data we would not know the procedure.

161
10:06.580 --> 10:09.820
So for that we need a language so that we can write a program.

162
10:09.880 --> 10:14.380
So what a program will contain data and a set of instructions upon that data.

163
10:14.390 --> 10:17.910
this are the main part or ingredients of a program.

164
10:18.370 --> 10:20.470
But this has to be written in machine language.

165
10:20.470 --> 10:21.690
We don't know machine language.

166
10:21.700 --> 10:27.280
So we introduce some intermediate language that is a programming language that is helpful for us.

167
10:27.460 --> 10:30.140
And it will translate that into machine language.

168
10:30.140 --> 10:30.900
Machine code.

169
10:31.270 --> 10:34.580
And the program that is understandable by CPU.

170
10:35.140 --> 10:38.920
So that's all in this video in the next few days I'll explain you what does it mean by compiler and

171
10:38.920 --> 10:39.550
what does it mean by

172
10:39.640 --> 10:41.560
INTERPRETER. What are the differences.

173
10:41.560 --> 10:46.090
By taking few examples I'll explain them, but I have already used their name here.

174
10:46.810 --> 10:47.220
That's what.
