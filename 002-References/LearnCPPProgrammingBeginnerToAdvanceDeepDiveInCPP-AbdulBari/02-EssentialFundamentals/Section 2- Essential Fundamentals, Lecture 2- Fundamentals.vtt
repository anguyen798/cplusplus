In this section I'll be discussing some fundamentals before learning programming language get awareness

1
00:05.730 --> 00:09.440
about few things if you are already aware of this.

2
00:09.470 --> 00:12.570
Then you can skip the section and you can go to the next section.

3
00:12.710 --> 00:13.750
Mostly in academics.

4
00:13.760 --> 00:15.330
These are the basics that are taught.

5
00:15.510 --> 00:21.320
So to get the awarness about the computers  so that we can understand how to use the computer means

6
00:21.770 --> 00:23.360
how to write the programs.

7
00:23.390 --> 00:25.030
How do you utilize them best.

8
00:25.160 --> 00:31.010
So far that these are the basic topics that I'm going to discuss like how computer works than what are the

9
00:31.010 --> 00:33.800
number systems like binary number system, octal number system.

10
00:33.800 --> 00:37.910
These are useful in understanding how computer works

11
00:38.090 --> 00:38.830
What is the program.

12
00:38.840 --> 00:41.300
Why we write the program how to write the program.

13
00:41.300 --> 00:46.380
These are the things that we will discuss and I work the high level and low level languages compiler 

14
00:46.400 --> 00:47.240
and the interpreter 

15
00:47.240 --> 00:48.230
This is very important.

16
00:48.230 --> 00:53.790
These differences are very very very important but then in an interview point of view it is also important 

17
00:54.080 --> 00:56.830
mostly stored and cannot differentiate them properly.

18
00:56.870 --> 01:01.350
So I have given a very detailed comparison of these two.

19
01:01.830 --> 01:04.940
Then what is an operating system little bit  about operating system.

20
01:05.750 --> 01:07.270
So let us start with the topic.
