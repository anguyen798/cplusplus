In this video I'll give you a brief introduction to operating systems there are well known operating system 

1
00:07.190 --> 00:12.340
for formerly people use them right on their laptops or on PCs.

2
00:12.350 --> 00:15.000
The known operating systems are Windows.

3
00:15.000 --> 00:19.490
This very famous operating system and Linux.

4
00:19.490 --> 00:24.440
This is mostly used by professionals or this is used in companies third.

5
00:24.740 --> 00:29.270
That is Mac OS X is operating system.

6
00:29.270 --> 00:31.850
These are the commonly found operating systems.

7
00:32.090 --> 00:38.900
So what actually an operating system is? see operating system is a master program.

8
00:39.110 --> 00:47.120
It will utilize all the resources of your computer system and provides services to the user.

9
00:47.470 --> 00:53.270
See these are the components in a computer system like already we have seen this CPU and the main memory

10
00:53.280 --> 00:54.860
then the input and output device.

11
00:54.890 --> 01:03.670
So I am showing keyboard mouse monitor printer and network and measurly hard disk right now.

12
01:03.720 --> 01:11.630
The programs are running here inside the main memory may require these very fellows

13
01:11.990 --> 01:15.830
all the resources of your computer system or let us draw a

14
01:15.880 --> 01:17.500
user also here.

15
01:17.530 --> 01:19.380
User is using computer systems.

16
01:19.400 --> 01:24.630
He may be using these resources like accessing internet or accessing some files and ALL.

17
01:25.040 --> 01:27.280
So program user will not directly use it.

18
01:27.280 --> 01:30.340
He will use them through a program only definitely.

19
01:30.380 --> 01:35.940
So finally users should be benefited from the resources and the program.

20
01:35.960 --> 01:41.210
So this the responsibility taken by an operating system and it means the environment it provides an

21
01:41.210 --> 01:45.290
environment easy for a user to use the computer system.

22
01:45.290 --> 01:54.920
So even on your mobile phone you have operating systems like Android operating system and IOS operating

23
01:54.920 --> 01:55.840
system.

24
01:56.930 --> 02:02.630
So on mobile phone also it's the same thing like you have a storage and the ram that is main memory

25
02:02.960 --> 02:04.310
and the processor is there.

26
02:04.400 --> 02:11.420
screen itself display on its screen itself works as an input or a touch

27
02:11.420 --> 02:12.500
device touchscreen.

28
02:13.010 --> 02:21.800
So both are similar. now let us know how operating system works. listen when you start your machine computer

29
02:21.800 --> 02:24.710
PC. or mobile phone or laptop.

30
02:24.830 --> 02:29.870
The first thing that you'll see is it is getting ready and if you're using Windows P.C. you will find

31
02:29.870 --> 02:35.400
a Windows logo and you will get a message of starting windows starting on your mobile phone Android

32
02:35.420 --> 02:40.050
mobile phone you will get a message at the bottom that is Android it's getting ready.

33
02:40.280 --> 02:47.080
So the very first thing when you start your machine a device it will get ready upon operating system.

34
02:47.150 --> 02:51.230
See operating system actually is present in the your storage on a hard disk.

35
02:51.320 --> 02:58.550
So I'm showing it as Windows Windows.EXC like Windows is also program operating system is also program.

36
02:58.970 --> 03:02.100
But it gets loaded by itself so it will start by itself.

37
03:02.220 --> 03:07.370
The moment when you will start your machine operating system will get loaded and operating system will

38
03:07.370 --> 03:15.000
start executing so that your hardware or your device get ready up on operating system.

39
03:15.020 --> 03:17.180
So this should come inside main memory.

40
03:17.180 --> 03:23.910
So I will  just write OS in short for operating system. operating system will get ready first inside

41
03:23.930 --> 03:28.700
the main memory and the CPU will start executing that operating system.

42
03:28.850 --> 03:34.330
So the very first thing that you get a screen that full of icons and cursor for mouse everything.

43
03:34.490 --> 03:40.670
All this is displayed by operating system and the operating system is ready to take the instruction

44
03:40.670 --> 03:42.820
for you or the commands from you.

45
03:43.460 --> 03:46.500
So you click on some icon for opening an application.

46
03:46.580 --> 03:47.880
So how it works.

47
03:47.930 --> 03:54.410
Operating system running here inside the CPU will bring that program inside the main memory and it

48
03:54.440 --> 03:56.780
will ask the CPU to execute that program.

49
03:57.920 --> 04:01.660
So that program runs within the context of operating system.

50
04:01.730 --> 04:05.650
Now it is not independent it's running as a part of operating system.

51
04:05.660 --> 04:11.800
within in the control of operating system it is perfectly monitored by operating system.

52
04:12.110 --> 04:15.060
So operating system will get our program execute

53
04:15.260 --> 04:20.300
When you touch on the icon on the screen or when you double click on the icon on the screen on the PC

54
04:20.600 --> 04:25.560
program will get into the main memory and an opening system will start executing it.

55
04:25.670 --> 04:34.640
Now the last thing when our program is accessing a monitor or printer or network anything program cannot

56
04:34.720 --> 04:37.970
directly access anything cannot directly access.

57
04:37.970 --> 04:44.260
It has to get the work done or make a request to the operating system.

58
04:44.300 --> 04:46.760
It has to display something on the monitor.

59
04:46.760 --> 04:51.230
It should ask the operating system that I wonder display this if something is typed from the keyboard

60
04:51.260 --> 04:52.260
that is coming in.

61
04:52.410 --> 04:59.620
And if a program wants that then it should ask the operating system to get that input so programs

62
04:59.650 --> 05:05.440
cannot access the hardware directly how to handle them how to access them like multiple programs

63
05:05.440 --> 05:06.840
may be running right.

64
05:06.850 --> 05:11.860
So one program cannot capture the device so operating system take care of all these things so it will

65
05:11.860 --> 05:19.420
manage the resources so everything has to be done via our operating system by making a request to operating

66
05:19.420 --> 05:19.940
system.

67
05:20.110 --> 05:26.470
So then any program any program but it is making a request to the operating system for accessing the

68
05:26.470 --> 05:34.210
resources or getting services from the operating system then it does that by using System calls system

69
05:34.210 --> 05:41.830
calls and we say that these are system calls or we also call it does API but system call is the right term

70
05:41.830 --> 05:47.620
for this one. Application program interface or system called a program will makes system calls for

71
05:47.620 --> 05:51.850
the operating system for availing services.

72
05:51.850 --> 05:56.890
So that's all I have explained you how operating system will start on the machine and how it will help

73
05:56.890 --> 06:03.610
our program execute. now in short operating system is a master program which will take all the resources

74
06:03.610 --> 06:11.740
under control and provide services like you may maybe knowing us sports department or library in your

75
06:11.740 --> 06:15.100
college like librarian will hold all the books right.

76
06:15.100 --> 06:16.830
He has a control over all of them.

77
06:16.870 --> 06:22.960
He has the authority to issue the book or claim the book back from a student so he decides who should

78
06:22.960 --> 06:27.580
get how many books are not for how much period a book should be given we should given to a student and everything

79
06:27.580 --> 06:28.530
he decides right.

80
06:29.010 --> 06:31.030
So a better book is available or not available.

81
06:31.030 --> 06:35.920
He knows everything so a student cannot directly go and pick up a book and take it home.

82
06:35.920 --> 06:41.770
He has to request to the librarian and when he is returning again he is give it back to the librarian.

83
06:41.920 --> 06:49.540
So library managers library that is a sources. Same way operating system manages all the resources of

84
06:49.540 --> 06:55.650
your computer system and the programs will use these resources with the help of operating system.

85
06:55.890 --> 07:00.170
thatsall little bit about  an operating system so now you should know that there is something

86
07:00.180 --> 07:07.900
called operating system also between CPU and the resources and your program.

87
07:08.070 --> 07:08.390
Right.

88
07:08.680 --> 07:13.810
So there are few things that are done by the operating system during run time of your program so you

89
07:13.810 --> 07:15.660
should be aware of this.

90
07:16.060 --> 07:20.830
So this is sufficient for about knowing about operating systems.

91
07:20.830 --> 07:27.070
So that's all in the section in the next section we will cover a few more concepts that are very useful

92
07:27.070 --> 07:28.670
for programming.
