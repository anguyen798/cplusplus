00:00.180 --> 00:04.980
In this video, we will see how to use a debugger in C++.

00:06.170 --> 00:10.220
Debugger is used for tracing the program line by line.

00:10.580 --> 00:14.660
We can watch the program and see how it is executing line by line.

00:16.870 --> 00:24.790
Sometimes if the program is not giving expected results or it is giving wrong output, then we may check

00:24.790 --> 00:29.470
the program line by line to check to find out where we have gone wrong.

00:31.920 --> 00:37.410
You'll be learning more about the usage of debugger in the coming videos while giving the demonstration

00:37.410 --> 00:38.100
of programs.

00:38.100 --> 00:43.230
I have used debugger sometimes, so even you can do it in C++.

00:43.380 --> 00:46.200
So let us see how to use a debugger so far.

00:46.210 --> 00:51.150
So for that, first of all, I will create a project and I will write one simple program.

00:51.150 --> 00:55.860
Then I will show you the options that you have to use for using a debugger.

00:57.150 --> 00:58.410
New project.

00:59.180 --> 01:02.780
And say console application and it's a C++ project.

01:02.810 --> 01:04.280
Let us name it as.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.470
And say, okay.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.270
Now hear the skeleton of a program is ready.

01:14.420 --> 01:16.730
I'll replace it with my program.

01:18.340 --> 01:18.700
Yeah.

01:18.700 --> 01:19.630
Here is the program.

01:19.630 --> 01:20.230
Ready?

01:20.320 --> 01:22.240
Now, don't go into the details of the program.

01:22.240 --> 01:26.140
This program is to find the sum of all these elements.

01:26.230 --> 01:29.770
Addition of these elements, that is one, two, five, eight, nine.

01:29.890 --> 01:34.810
So it will give the sum of all these elements that's going to be 25.

01:35.590 --> 01:39.040
So let us first compile the program.

01:39.420 --> 01:40.120
I'll.

01:43.010 --> 01:44.120
Let us first.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.940
Let us first compile and build the program.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.700
So go to execute and see.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.020
Compile and run.

01:54.050 --> 01:55.880
She's asking me to save the file.

01:55.900 --> 01:56.350
Yes.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.090
May not keep saved.

01:59.350 --> 02:00.310
Yes.

02:04.460 --> 02:05.450
So it's giving the result.

02:05.450 --> 02:06.560
That is 25.

02:07.620 --> 02:10.350
No, this is a normal execution.

02:10.350 --> 02:13.290
I have done now one I have compiled.

02:13.290 --> 02:15.390
So the program is ready to run now.

02:15.390 --> 02:18.660
So instead of running, I will perform debugging.

02:20.590 --> 02:25.740
So for debugging, first of all, we have to put a breakpoint upon any statement.

02:25.750 --> 02:28.560
So on the first statement itself, I'll put a breakpoint.

02:28.570 --> 02:33.700
So for putting a breakpoint in dev C++, just click on the statement here.

02:33.700 --> 02:37.570
I have clicked on the number right on the left hand side, leftmost corner.

02:37.570 --> 02:38.740
I have just clicked here.

02:38.740 --> 02:40.450
If you again click, it will be gone.

02:40.450 --> 02:44.680
So for toggling you can just click and click once again it's gone.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.150
So it's like on and off.

02:46.540 --> 02:49.270
So now it is on, right?

02:49.390 --> 02:51.490
So this statement is having breakpoint.

02:51.490 --> 02:56.860
So when I run the debugger, it will come and stop here so that from there I can carry on by executing

02:56.860 --> 02:58.900
the statements one by one.

02:59.620 --> 03:01.000
So let us start the debugger.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
So for starting a debugger I can go to execute now this time instead of calling run or compiler run,

03:07.030 --> 03:11.830
just go down at the in the menu options and select debug.

03:12.370 --> 03:16.210
So you can see that even I can do it using F5.

03:16.210 --> 03:18.790
So you can even press F5 for.

03:19.980 --> 03:21.120
Starting debugger.

03:22.260 --> 03:24.150
Now, here it is at this line.

03:24.150 --> 03:26.220
It has not yet executed the line.

03:26.850 --> 03:29.100
Now I want to know what are the values in these variables?

03:29.100 --> 03:34.440
So the variables that I have are some and A and X, these are some variables.

03:34.770 --> 03:38.460
So let us add these variables in a watch.

03:38.580 --> 03:43.050
So for this I will select the sum and right click.

03:43.350 --> 03:44.880
And here is an option.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.200
Add watch.

03:46.650 --> 03:50.010
So it is added to a watch and the sum variable is zero right now.

03:50.740 --> 03:51.880
And a.

03:53.760 --> 03:59.780
And right click say Ad Watch is added and it is having some garbage values.

03:59.790 --> 04:01.140
It's not having these values.

04:01.140 --> 04:05.250
One, two, five, eight, nine, because this line is not yet executed.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.070
Then I have one more variable x.

04:08.070 --> 04:10.680
I will select this and add watch.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.200
So execute to evaluate.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.350
So what is the result of this?

04:17.360 --> 04:20.390
X is not yet known because it has not yet reached here.

04:20.510 --> 04:24.020
My my program has executed till this line.

04:24.020 --> 04:31.460
So the line which is highlighted it is here now let us execute it step by step and see how these values

04:31.460 --> 04:33.080
in the watch are changing.

04:33.080 --> 04:40.520
So you have to observe here this area and here I will be executing the statements line by line and here

04:40.520 --> 04:41.450
there is a loop.

04:41.450 --> 04:47.170
So this will be repeatedly executing and the value of some will also be changing because it will be

04:47.210 --> 04:49.700
keep on adding the value of X into sum.

04:50.150 --> 04:51.590
So let us see it now.

04:51.590 --> 04:56.510
So for executing next line here at the bottom, we have option like next line.

04:56.510 --> 05:04.370
So you can press this or even you can press F seven, you can see there is a tooltip popping up showing

05:04.370 --> 05:06.740
that for next line press f seven.

05:07.130 --> 05:08.990
So I'll press next line.

05:08.990 --> 05:10.490
So it is on the next line.

05:10.700 --> 05:13.610
Now I'm pressing F seven for continuation.

05:14.180 --> 05:19.310
Now after this line you can see that the array values, these values will be changing, right?

05:19.310 --> 05:20.150
It is on this line.

05:20.150 --> 05:21.560
It has not error executed.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.110
So this values will be changing.

05:24.110 --> 05:29.390
C earlier it was on some and already some was having zero so that actually the value was garbage.

05:29.390 --> 05:31.580
Then again, zero is a sign, right?

05:31.580 --> 05:33.470
So garbage value can be even zero.

05:33.470 --> 05:35.930
Here you can see inside a one of the values zero.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.930
So it has not yet executed this line.

05:38.930 --> 05:44.480
So press f seven is now re is initialized with these values here.

05:44.480 --> 05:49.310
You can see this on the left hand side and the debug window you can see this one.

05:49.310 --> 05:50.240
This is watch.

05:50.660 --> 05:58.220
Watching the contents of the variables right now press f seven now does enter inside follow you can

05:59.090 --> 06:06.980
drag this blue color line now some hands became one, an x value was one, now x becomes two.

06:07.490 --> 06:10.130
Now it will be added to sum and some becomes three.

06:10.640 --> 06:12.050
Now X became five.

06:12.050 --> 06:14.150
It will be added to some and some becomes eight.

06:14.150 --> 06:15.350
So you can watch here.

06:15.410 --> 06:16.850
Some became eight.

06:16.850 --> 06:18.200
An x value is five.

06:18.230 --> 06:20.930
So the next after five it is eight.

06:20.930 --> 06:21.800
So let us see.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.980
Next is X became eight.

06:24.980 --> 06:27.020
So some should become 16.

06:27.020 --> 06:31.130
Yes, some became 16, then x is becoming nine.

06:31.130 --> 06:33.200
So then some became 25.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.580
So end of this loop.

06:34.580 --> 06:35.930
And this is printed.

06:37.410 --> 06:40.920
So if you see the window here, you can watch here.

06:40.930 --> 06:42.540
The value 25 is printed.

06:47.480 --> 06:53.240
So this is how we can trace how the program is working and closely observe how the values of the variables

06:53.240 --> 06:58.820
are changing and if anything unexpected found, then you can make corrections in your code.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.100
So that's all about debugging.

07:01.100 --> 07:07.730
So you remember the options that you have to go here and execute and start the debugger, and then afterwards

07:07.730 --> 07:14.600
you have to just keep on pressing next line or F7 and for watching the variables, you have to select

07:14.600 --> 07:19.760
the variable and say Add watch or even you can click on this add watch button and here you can enter

07:19.760 --> 07:20.690
the variable in.

07:22.250 --> 07:27.200
So that's all about debugger and maybe showing it again in some of the programs, how to use the debugger

07:27.200 --> 07:28.520
for that particular program.
