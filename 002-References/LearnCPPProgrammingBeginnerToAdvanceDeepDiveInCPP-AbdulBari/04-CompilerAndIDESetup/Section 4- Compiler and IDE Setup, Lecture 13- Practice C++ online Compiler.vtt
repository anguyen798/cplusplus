00:00.150 --> 00:06.030
Now let us see where to write our programs, where to write C++ programs.

00:06.030 --> 00:07.920
So there are various IDs.

00:07.920 --> 00:15.300
You can use the IDs and also you can practice your programs on online compiler.

00:15.300 --> 00:19.650
So I suggest you to better use online compilers, right?

00:19.650 --> 00:25.400
So if you face any difficulty, you can share the code and we can test it on same online compiler and

00:25.400 --> 00:26.850
it can we can help you better.

00:26.850 --> 00:28.620
And also you can use the IDs.

00:28.620 --> 00:31.890
I will show you how to use the IDs in the next lectures.

00:32.730 --> 00:38.820
If you are already using some ID and comfortable with some ID like code blocks or Def, C++ or Visual

00:38.820 --> 00:40.200
Studio, you can use it.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.040
All right.

00:41.040 --> 00:47.010
So now I will show you where to practice C++ programs online.

00:47.160 --> 00:56.520
So open Chrome browser and here type online GDB online gdb.

00:56.820 --> 00:59.700
So don't select dotcom, don't select dotcom.

00:59.700 --> 01:03.120
Just give space and say C++.

01:03.840 --> 01:09.480
Don't directly go to dotcom, write online, GDB, C++.

01:10.470 --> 01:13.680
If you want to use a C, you can use C also.

01:13.680 --> 01:19.920
So enter now the first link that is online compiler and debugger for C and C++.

01:19.920 --> 01:20.970
Click on this one.

01:20.970 --> 01:23.850
So here you are on online gdb.

01:24.650 --> 01:25.110
Right.

01:25.130 --> 01:26.040
There's a compiler.

01:26.060 --> 01:27.980
No, you can read it in the URL.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.680
It is online C++ compiler.

01:30.710 --> 01:31.400
All right.

01:31.430 --> 01:36.710
Now, one important thing on the right hand side, on the right hand top, you can see here, C++ is

01:36.710 --> 01:38.780
selected right on the right hand side.

01:38.810 --> 01:40.250
C++ is selected.

01:40.400 --> 01:45.480
That is the reason I told you to type on GDB and C++ then.

01:45.500 --> 01:50.210
In Google search it has already shown you C++ links, so we directly came here.

01:50.420 --> 01:54.080
Otherwise if you want to change the language, you can change the language.

01:54.080 --> 01:59.030
You can select other languages also like Java or C language or other languages.

01:59.030 --> 02:01.520
So there are many various languages all available.

02:01.640 --> 02:06.180
So you can use this online compiler for various languages.

02:06.200 --> 02:06.740
All right.

02:06.770 --> 02:10.370
But we are using it for C++, so don't touch anything.

02:10.370 --> 02:17.930
Just leave it, because already you have selected C++ compiler and you can see that so readily available.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.570
Some piece of code is available here.

02:20.570 --> 02:22.410
That is C++ code is available here.

02:22.430 --> 02:24.450
So it is a hello world program.

02:24.470 --> 02:26.430
It will print Hello World.

02:26.460 --> 02:26.840
All right.

02:26.840 --> 02:28.690
So I don't have to type anything.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.740
This is a sample program is already available.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.780
Just click on run.

02:32.870 --> 02:34.010
It will run the code.

02:34.040 --> 02:35.420
Here it is at the bottom.

02:35.420 --> 02:36.740
It has shown the result.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.150
That is Hello world.

02:38.180 --> 02:38.630
All right.

02:38.660 --> 02:42.600
Now, if you want to write something in your program, just as a sample, I will write down.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.250
Okay.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.250
So later, we will be learning about this one.

02:47.180 --> 02:49.180
I'm not going to explain what I am writing.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.660
I just am testing it.

02:50.660 --> 03:01.100
And two numbers then seen reading two numbers X and Y, then z, assign x plus y.

03:01.130 --> 03:03.710
I am writing a program for adding to numbers.

03:03.710 --> 03:06.740
So instead of Hello World I will just modify it.

03:06.740 --> 03:10.040
I'm not writing it separately.

03:10.310 --> 03:14.510
Some s addition of two numbers is print z.

03:14.540 --> 03:17.170
Now don't try to understand anything, okay?

03:17.210 --> 03:17.780
Just.

03:17.780 --> 03:21.920
I have written something to demonstrate that you can write any program here.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.890
You don't have to touch anything just inside the main function.

03:24.890 --> 03:26.180
Start writing a program.

03:26.210 --> 03:28.610
So I have written my code in main function.

03:28.610 --> 03:31.590
Now let us run it and see whether it will add it to numbers or not.

03:31.610 --> 03:33.470
So it's asking me to enter two numbers.

03:33.470 --> 03:38.200
I'll give the first number as ten and second number as 20, and the result is 30.

03:38.210 --> 03:38.960
So I'm starting.

03:38.960 --> 03:40.490
Yes, it is working perfectly.

03:40.490 --> 03:42.290
So that's it, this is a better place.

03:42.290 --> 03:42.680
Alright.

03:42.680 --> 03:46.370
And if you find there are many compilers available, online compilers are available, you can practice

03:46.370 --> 03:47.280
any way you like.

03:47.300 --> 03:50.060
All right, so this is the way you can practice online.

03:50.420 --> 03:50.920
All right.

03:50.930 --> 03:56.400
And if you want to install it in the next lectures, you will find how to install it on your machine.

03:56.420 --> 03:57.020
All right.

03:57.020 --> 03:59.210
So that's all in this lecture.

03:59.210 --> 04:01.550
So practice programs here in online.
