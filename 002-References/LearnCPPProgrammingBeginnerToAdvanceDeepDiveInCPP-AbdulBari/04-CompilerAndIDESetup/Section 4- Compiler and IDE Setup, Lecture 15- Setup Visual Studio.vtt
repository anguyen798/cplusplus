00:02.400 --> 00:06.360
In this video, we will see how to download and set up Visual Studio.

00:06.390 --> 00:11.100
So open the browser and search for download Visual Studio.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.470
The first link is from Microsoft, so click on it.

00:21.930 --> 00:25.350
It will take you to the website, Microsoft website here.

00:25.350 --> 00:31.470
There are various versions of Visual Studio available, so you can select the first one that is for

00:31.470 --> 00:37.470
community, and it is a free version for students and for researchers.

00:37.470 --> 00:39.390
So select the first one.

00:39.390 --> 00:41.280
Click on free download.

00:48.470 --> 00:49.790
It will start downloading.

00:52.330 --> 00:54.640
And it will pop up and ask you to select the.

00:55.680 --> 01:00.990
Type of applications that you are going to develop while it is downloading, it will ask you to select

01:00.990 --> 01:06.300
the type of applications that you will be developing so you can select desktop application and sign

01:06.300 --> 01:09.600
up by entering your email ID and selecting your country.

01:09.630 --> 01:11.760
Click on the file for installation.

01:12.510 --> 01:14.730
After signup, you can start installation.

01:16.020 --> 01:16.230
Here.

01:16.230 --> 01:17.670
The installation starts.

01:22.740 --> 01:23.160
Yes.

01:23.160 --> 01:25.230
Here it gives options for what purpose?

01:25.230 --> 01:31.470
You want to download C++ so you can select desktop development with C++.

01:31.470 --> 01:33.210
So select this option.

01:34.690 --> 01:36.550
And click on install.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.440
It's and struggle.

01:43.400 --> 01:48.590
It will install Visual Studio for C++.

01:58.730 --> 02:01.730
Once the installation is over, you have to restart your computer.

02:01.730 --> 02:02.840
So restart it.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.950
So the installation of Visual Studio has finished.

02:07.980 --> 02:13.020
Now let us start Visual Studio and develop 1/1 project.

02:13.380 --> 02:18.080
So good to start menu and here I will type Visual Studio.

02:18.090 --> 02:20.860
So this is the Visual Studio 2019.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.320
So click on this one.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.230
Here it started.

02:26.070 --> 02:30.510
Now here, say, create new project.

02:30.510 --> 02:31.680
So select this one.

02:31.680 --> 02:32.270
Right.

02:32.280 --> 02:37.380
So for every program that you write, I suggest you create a new project that is better and you can

02:37.380 --> 02:40.800
have all the projects in one folder next.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.170
Here you have to select the type of the project.

02:43.170 --> 02:47.070
So on the top left you will find here the language.

02:47.070 --> 02:50.340
So select it as C++, right?

02:50.340 --> 02:52.140
And the platform is Windows.

02:52.140 --> 02:52.330
Okay.

02:52.410 --> 02:53.940
You need not select that one.

02:53.970 --> 02:56.540
Just you can leave it as it is for all platform.

02:56.550 --> 03:00.810
If you scroll down, you'll find one option that is console app.

03:01.020 --> 03:03.570
So you have to select console app, right?

03:03.570 --> 03:07.650
So, so all the applications that we are going to develop are console applications.

03:07.650 --> 03:11.850
So you always have to select this one, say next.

03:12.840 --> 03:16.050
Now here you have to mention the project name.

03:16.050 --> 03:24.210
So I'll give the project name as my first and you have to select the part so you can select the part

03:24.210 --> 03:26.130
and then say create.

03:32.660 --> 03:36.740
So project is created and here is the sample code.

03:36.740 --> 03:40.100
The code is ready, so all the remain function is available.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.350
So you can start typing your program here.

03:42.830 --> 03:43.130
Right.

03:43.130 --> 03:47.390
Already, the basic header file or the standard header file is already included.

03:47.480 --> 03:54.770
That is IU's stream and hello world program is automatically generated now here on the right hand side

03:54.770 --> 04:01.850
in the solution explorer or in this window, if you expand the source file you will find this my first

04:01.850 --> 04:02.540
step.

04:02.570 --> 04:06.050
So this is what the file it is showing here, right?

04:08.320 --> 04:14.560
If you want to write a program, simply, I will write one program with the three variables A, B,

04:14.560 --> 04:20.160
C, and then assign some value and be assigned with some value.

04:20.170 --> 04:20.860
Then C.

04:20.860 --> 04:24.790
Assign a plus b.

04:25.960 --> 04:32.530
Now I will display this value also standard CDC out.

04:32.950 --> 04:38.650
See and also study.

04:38.650 --> 04:43.600
And this will add to numbers and display them.

04:43.630 --> 04:47.370
Now here you can see that something is underlined here with red color.

04:47.380 --> 04:49.000
So this shows it's an error.

04:50.380 --> 04:54.550
So this ID will help you to find the errors wherever you are going wrong.

04:54.580 --> 04:56.470
So it's very programmer friendly.

04:56.470 --> 05:00.190
So here actually I have given a single colon, so I should try scope resolution.

05:00.190 --> 05:03.310
So double time I have to write colon.

05:03.310 --> 05:04.840
So now this is perfect.

05:05.530 --> 05:06.850
Now let us see how to run.

05:06.850 --> 05:14.040
So here we can go to build menu option on the top and say build solution or build my first.

05:14.050 --> 05:15.730
So this is my first build.

05:15.730 --> 05:20.020
So it will be compiled and executable will be created.

05:20.050 --> 05:26.590
Now for running go to debug option for running go to debug option and start without debugging.

05:27.100 --> 05:30.660
So debugger, I'll be showing you in the next video.

05:30.670 --> 05:33.010
So without debugging, just we want to run.

05:33.010 --> 05:36.130
So you can also press control F5 for running the program.

05:36.520 --> 05:39.100
So run this one now here displays.

05:41.310 --> 05:45.600
Now here displays the result that is 1030, ten plus 20 is 30.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.680
And also Hello World.

05:48.600 --> 05:49.380
So that's it.

05:49.380 --> 05:52.140
So you can complete the program and you can remove all these comments.

05:52.140 --> 05:55.440
If you don't like them, you can type all your programs.

05:55.440 --> 06:00.300
So for every time, for every program, I suggest you to create a new project and do it and let the

06:00.300 --> 06:04.140
project name be same as the program that you're doing it for.

06:04.170 --> 06:08.460
If you would like to use Visual Studio, this is how you can set up and start using it.
