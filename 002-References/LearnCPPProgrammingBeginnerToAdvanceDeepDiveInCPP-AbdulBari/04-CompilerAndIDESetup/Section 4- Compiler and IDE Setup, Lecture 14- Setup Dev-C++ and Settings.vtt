00:00.780 --> 00:08.640
In this video, I will show you how to download Def C++, how to set it up and how to use it.

00:09.300 --> 00:13.410
So this is an ID I use for writing C++ program.

00:13.740 --> 00:21.350
Most of the students use Def C++, so let us learn how to download and set up.

00:21.360 --> 00:31.920
So open Google Chrome and Google Chrome search for download def C++ with min g w.

00:32.580 --> 00:33.570
So already there.

00:33.570 --> 00:35.070
I have searched for it already.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.740
So this is the thing that you have to type.

00:37.800 --> 00:44.990
Just note down, make sure you are searching for the same thing, same string download dev c++ with

00:45.060 --> 00:48.390
min gw min GW is a compiler.

00:48.390 --> 00:56.310
So when you download dev C++ it's an ID along with that compiler will also get downloaded and installed

00:56.310 --> 00:57.270
on your machine.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.250
So just hit enter.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.180
Then you'll find various links.

01:03.270 --> 01:08.250
Click on the first link that is from SourceForge Dot Net.

01:08.490 --> 01:10.410
So click on this one.

01:11.100 --> 01:16.440
Now here we are on a download page on SourceForge website.

01:16.740 --> 01:18.960
Click on this green button.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.380
You can read it.

01:20.400 --> 01:22.320
Download latest version.

01:22.380 --> 01:25.140
Def C++ 5.11.

01:25.330 --> 01:28.680
EDM cc 4.99.2.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.580
Setup dot x.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.250
Make sure you have reached the same link.

01:32.280 --> 01:32.790
Right.

01:32.820 --> 01:35.670
You should read it and check you are on the same link.

01:36.090 --> 01:37.200
Click on this one.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.960
It will start downloading after downloading install dev C++.

01:50.790 --> 01:51.420
Okay.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.300
It has finished installation.

02:11.900 --> 02:20.330
If I show you the folder where dev C++ is installed, this is in C and program files.

02:21.310 --> 02:23.020
And here is CP.

02:23.050 --> 02:30.550
So you can see that there is also install min GW that is GMU compiler for Windows.

02:30.550 --> 02:33.130
This is a minimal compiler for Windows.

02:33.550 --> 02:35.500
Let us start dev C++.

02:36.330 --> 02:40.010
So English language selected the next then.

02:40.020 --> 02:40.560
Okay.

02:40.950 --> 02:41.660
Yes.

02:41.670 --> 02:43.680
Def C++ is ready now.

02:43.920 --> 02:49.560
Before we start using it, we have to make some important settings and these settings we have to do

02:49.560 --> 02:50.540
only once.

02:50.550 --> 02:52.860
So let me show you what settings we have to do.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.620
Go to the menu and the menu.

02:55.680 --> 03:04.200
You'll find tools on the top, then select compiler options and here few tabs are there.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.490
That is the general tab.

03:05.490 --> 03:08.610
Inside this mention hyphen g.

03:09.600 --> 03:14.340
This will allow the compiler or the debugger to debug the program.

03:14.580 --> 03:19.620
So there's a flag for the compiler which will allow the debugger to debug the program.

03:19.620 --> 03:20.970
So what is debugging and all?

03:21.000 --> 03:23.070
We will see it later in the next videos.

03:23.880 --> 03:29.490
You have to mention this hyphen G or minus G, then go to another tab.

03:29.490 --> 03:30.900
That is programs.

03:34.490 --> 03:35.930
Here, you'll find Jesus.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.690
So for that Jesus wrote X is given.

03:38.810 --> 03:47.660
And this compiler by default it will be C++ 98 version, but will be using the features of C++ 11.

03:47.660 --> 03:49.510
That is that is the later version.

03:49.520 --> 03:53.660
So to use C++ 11, we have to mention here.

03:53.750 --> 03:58.490
So this is what you are supposed to write, hyphen STD.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.270
That is minus STD.

04:00.290 --> 04:05.900
You can delete as then equal to C++ 11.

04:07.310 --> 04:10.320
Then do the same thing in the next field.

04:10.340 --> 04:15.980
Also write C++ 11, HDC, C++ 11.

04:17.810 --> 04:20.180
It can be kept a lot small C++.

04:20.540 --> 04:22.010
That doesn't make difference.

04:22.400 --> 04:27.830
By mentioning this now, the ID will be using C++ 11 compiler.

04:28.730 --> 04:34.020
Now we are using the in our course will be we will be using the features of C++ 11 also.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.700
So if this is not mentioned, those features will not work.

04:38.120 --> 04:42.290
So this is the very important thing that you have to do in the settings.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.640
Now we are ready.

04:43.640 --> 04:47.150
Just say, okay, now the settings are done.

04:47.900 --> 04:52.880
Now we are ready to do any project or write over C++ programs.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.930
So let me show you how to create a new project.

04:59.410 --> 05:00.940
Say a new project.

05:01.860 --> 05:04.260
And Select Console application.

05:04.680 --> 05:07.410
Let the project name as my first.

05:10.170 --> 05:12.240
And it should be created in documents.

05:13.140 --> 05:14.610
Now the project is ready.

05:15.060 --> 05:17.850
This is main door zip file inside the project.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.980
So here, I'll just give a message.

05:20.340 --> 05:21.600
Hello world.

05:22.050 --> 05:22.890
And.

05:23.280 --> 05:28.520
And they should use namespace for code as well as.

05:28.530 --> 05:34.740
And then let us build the project and execute.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.290
Now Helloworld has appeared.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.090
So that's all.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.720
This is how you can open a new project for every program or application.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.870
You can start a new project or else for practicing in the same project.

05:45.870 --> 05:50.190
You can go on writing new code there and you can recompile and run it.
