00:00.360 --> 00:03.500
Let us write a program for reversing a number.

1
00:04.950 --> 00:11.010
If a number is given we want to reverse that number not just displaying we want to reverse of that number

2
00:11.040 --> 00:12.840
as a number a single number.

3
00:12.840 --> 00:18.130
Let's suppose if the number is 153 we want the reverse of that that is three hundred and fifty one.

4
00:18.480 --> 00:19.780
How we can do that.

5
00:19.860 --> 00:21.210
Let us get the basic idea.

6
00:21.750 --> 00:22.710
How do you do that.

7
00:22.710 --> 00:28.370
The procedure is similar to the previous video where we have check Armstrong and take out digits, same thing

8
00:28.910 --> 00:30.560
but a little different.

9
00:30.570 --> 00:31.590
So what is the idea.

10
00:31.590 --> 00:33.630
Let us get the basic idea here first.

11
00:33.750 --> 00:36.360
See we already know how to pick out the digits.

12
00:36.420 --> 00:38.290
So First of all  i got 3.

13
00:38.820 --> 00:40.510
Next time I will get five.

14
00:40.620 --> 00:46.600
How to make this three and five together as 35.

15
00:46.890 --> 00:49.170
If I add them they will become eight.

16
00:49.170 --> 00:55.580
I want to make 35, how to make  35 multiplied three by ten a nine to five.

17
00:55.980 --> 00:57.770
So this will become how much.

18
00:57.780 --> 00:58.730
Thirty five.

19
00:58.910 --> 01:01.690
Yes then no I have thirty five.

20
01:01.740 --> 01:04.870
How do I make it as one last digit when i get 1.

21
01:04.920 --> 01:07.200
So how to make it as a three hundred and fifty one.

22
01:07.710 --> 01:12.770
So if you want to add a digit at the last of a current number multiplied by ten then add 1.

23
01:13.060 --> 01:15.930
So multiply it by ten and add one.

24
01:16.020 --> 01:18.430
So this is 350 plus one.

25
01:18.450 --> 01:20.510
Three hundred and fifty one.

26
01:20.770 --> 01:22.670
Then how that first three was added.

27
01:22.890 --> 01:26.080
So this was zero into ten plus three.

28
01:26.130 --> 01:27.170
That was three.

29
01:27.210 --> 01:34.530
So you can see that every digit you take out multiply it by ten and add it right multiply a no.  and 

30
01:34.630 --> 01:36.050
add it.

31
01:36.080 --> 01:40.400
So this procedure if you repeat digit by digit you get the reverse of a number.

32
01:41.120 --> 01:44.980
So already i have number, you know how to take out the digits right.

33
01:45.010 --> 01:49.230
We already know, this is the same logic we have to take mod and divide the number.

34
01:49.250 --> 01:53.020
Now digits we are getting 3 5 1, how to make it as a number.

35
01:53.300 --> 01:57.520
So for this we need one more variable, let us say 'reverse'
and it is zero

36
01:57.590 --> 02:05.290
So first time  0 X 10 + 3 = 3 second time three into 10 plus five.

37
02:05.320 --> 02:06.390
That's 35.

38
02:06.860 --> 02:08.660
Third time thirty five into

39
02:08.750 --> 02:13.520
10 Plus 1 is 351.

40
02:13.880 --> 02:17.680
So this we are adding every time so present number is multiplied by 10.

41
02:17.690 --> 02:19.040
And this is added.

42
02:19.040 --> 02:21.560
So what is the statement here.

43
02:21.580 --> 02:29.750
reverse is equals to reverse into 10 plus, 3 5 1 3 5 1.

44
02:29.750 --> 02:31.850
What is that? r.

45
02:32.630 --> 02:33.740
That's it.

46
02:33.770 --> 02:39.320
If you perform these steps then in 'rev' we get the reverse of a number.

47
02:39.450 --> 02:42.410
So already we know the whole procedure just one statement extra.

48
02:42.410 --> 02:45.190
We are writing to form a reverse of the number.

49
02:45.950 --> 02:51.050
Now let us write the program, so for that let us look at the flow chart. so flow chart is same.

50
02:51.290 --> 02:57.140
I have added a extra line see if you this flow chart is same as the amstrong number flow chart there

51
02:57.140 --> 03:03.800
I was adding the cubes of their digits now i am multiplying remainder reverse with  10 then adding

52
03:03.800 --> 03:04.140
remainder

53
03:04.220 --> 03:09.940
So this extra line I have done and at the end, I don't have to check anything just I'm printing printing reverse

54
03:09.990 --> 03:10.690
off a number.

55
03:11.030 --> 03:12.840
So the loop is also same.

56
03:12.920 --> 03:15.220
Everything is same. now here,

57
03:15.230 --> 03:18.200
I don't need sum I need reverse of a number.

58
03:18.290 --> 03:28.810
Initially 0. then here a reverse of anumber is the reverse of the number into 10 plus r. at the end of the loop

59
03:28.820 --> 03:31.070
a loop will get a reverse of a number.

60
03:32.420 --> 03:43.390
So say reverse number is REV, we are getting it that's all. return zero.

61
03:43.430 --> 03:51.840
end of the main function. this the same program just one line has change and it has became a new program.

62
03:51.900 --> 03:52.280
See.

63
03:52.280 --> 03:57.140
Again I'm telling you you are learning logic or the procedure so that you're learning right.

64
03:57.170 --> 04:01.100
That's the first time next time we forget a similar thing then you can solve it.

65
04:01.650 --> 04:02.340
OK.

66
04:02.420 --> 04:04.990
So you must practice this one as much as possible.

67
04:05.300 --> 04:06.740
So that's all with this program.

68
04:06.740 --> 04:10.210
So you have to write this program and demo is also available.

69
04:10.730 --> 04:16.730
Now next thing there are some coding excersices i will explain you about that you can solve them.

70
04:16.730 --> 04:19.580
So i will remove this and I'll explain about it.

71
04:20.420 --> 04:21.890
Yes look at this.

72
04:21.890 --> 04:22.880
This is a number.

73
04:23.120 --> 04:25.730
If i reverse it I'll get the same number.

74
04:25.910 --> 04:32.930
So if reverse of a number is the same as the original number then we call it as a palindrome.

75
04:33.110 --> 04:36.470
It is called as palindrome if you reverse this one.

76
04:36.470 --> 04:38.910
This will be 1 2 2 1.

77
04:39.110 --> 04:40.040
Same thing.

78
04:40.070 --> 04:45.720
The reverse is also same so reverse is same as original number then it is called s palindrome.

79
04:46.010 --> 04:46.430
That's all.

80
04:47.150 --> 04:52.510
So you have to write a program or the coding exercises you have to write, where you have to check weather the

81
04:52.510 --> 04:54.250
a number is palindrome or not.

82
04:54.260 --> 05:02.160
How do you check first of all reverse it reversing logic is there, same procedure we get the number in

83
05:03.140 --> 05:08.330
rev, then check it with n what mind one thing n will become zero.

84
05:08.360 --> 05:08.860
Right.

85
05:08.900 --> 05:11.690
We are going on dividing until n becomes zero.

86
05:11.690 --> 05:12.710
So n will becomes zero.

87
05:12.710 --> 05:18.950
So for that you should have 1 more variable m and you should store that m into N. see

88
05:18.950 --> 05:21.200
This was for previous one, I did not remove it.

89
05:21.290 --> 05:29.050
So m assign n you must do it then at the last outside loop you should check whether M and rev are same

90
05:29.050 --> 05:31.790
if there are same it's a palindrome.

91
05:32.540 --> 05:38.550
So this is what do you have to do as a coding excersice reversing you know just checking if it is the same

92
05:38.880 --> 05:43.920
if it is same, then say it's a palindrome, otherwise not a palindrome.

93
05:44.720 --> 05:45.220
this is about

94
05:45.220 --> 05:46.220
palindrome i told you.

95
05:46.260 --> 05:47.720
That is a coding excercise

96
05:47.900 --> 05:49.680
Now there is one more coding excercise

97
05:49.690 --> 05:54.230
I'll explain youabout that one also. my next coding exercise,

98
05:54.230 --> 06:01.700
If a number is given like one hundred and fourty five you have to display our number in the words

99
06:02.850 --> 06:05.880
one four five.

100
06:06.030 --> 06:13.530
So the output should be one four five.

101
06:13.530 --> 06:19.570
Display a number in words how to do this.

102
06:19.830 --> 06:23.580
We want each and every digit then for 1.

103
06:23.580 --> 06:25.480
We can display one.

104
06:25.500 --> 06:25.770
All right.

105
06:25.770 --> 06:28.780
For 4 we can display, if it is 1 we can display one.

106
06:28.780 --> 06:33.750
so already we have seen in such case how to display the digits and words so the same procedure you can

107
06:33.750 --> 06:34.490
use here.

108
06:34.560 --> 06:37.170
But we want the digits 1 4 to 5.

109
06:37.180 --> 06:41.870
How we can get the digits one seperate four separate five separate so reverse a number.

110
06:42.150 --> 06:47.020
You can get the digits so take out the digits, but if I take out the digit I'll get 5 first.

111
06:47.280 --> 06:48.170
I want one.

112
06:48.320 --> 06:50.770
So that it reverse the number first.

113
06:50.880 --> 06:53.730
So it will become 541.

114
06:53.760 --> 06:55.350
Now take out the digits again.

115
06:55.560 --> 06:57.930
So this logic reversing.

116
06:57.930 --> 06:59.610
Again it has to be extended again.

117
06:59.610 --> 07:01.480
Again you have to do a similar thing.

118
07:01.490 --> 07:02.300
Take out the digit.

119
07:02.310 --> 07:03.340
Now you get 1, one.

120
07:03.380 --> 07:07.320
next 4 say four, then 5

121
07:07.320 --> 07:17.650
Say five. so you have a coding exercise for displaying a number printing a number in words.

122
07:17.730 --> 07:20.310
So you have to do it two times reverse it.

123
07:20.340 --> 07:23.250
Then again take out the digits so thats all about this procedure.

124
07:23.280 --> 07:28.800
So based on taking out the digital of a number one by one we have learned various things that we have

125
07:28.800 --> 07:29.620
seen.

126
07:29.630 --> 07:35.280
reverse displaying a number Armstrong Number, palindrome or not reversing a number displaying a number in

127
07:35.610 --> 07:36.510
words.

128
07:36.510 --> 07:38.470
So these are the various things that we can do.

129
07:38.610 --> 07:44.520
Once you know how to pick out the digits of a number so that all, practise this programs and do the

130
07:44.520 --> 07:48.960
coding exercise, do the programs also by yourself that's all in this video.
