00:00.560 --> 00:06.990
LET us see different types of loops, first loop that I will show you is while loop.

1
00:07.180 --> 00:12.120
And here one is given then cout

2
00:15.320 --> 00:16.200
hello.

3
00:16.700 --> 00:22.120
Now here this loop will repeat as long as this condition is true.

4
00:22.490 --> 00:26.100
All that I have given one so this'll be always true.

5
00:26.240 --> 00:29.500
So it means this will enter into infinite loop.

6
00:29.660 --> 00:37.940
Let us see this continuously displaying hello hello go on displaying hello. even I am unable to

7
00:37.940 --> 00:40.120
scroll up so it's go on displaying

8
00:40.130 --> 00:40.680
Hello.

9
00:40.850 --> 00:45.790
This has entered into infinite loop so as this is always true.

10
00:45.920 --> 00:47.940
So this is in finite loop.

11
00:48.260 --> 00:50.530
See these many times it has displayed.

12
00:50.540 --> 01:00.090
Hello I'm scrolling here on this window, so many times I had to stop this program forcibly because it

13
01:00.090 --> 01:01.260
was not terminating.

14
01:01.260 --> 01:09.070
It is in finite loop now instead of that I want to run it for some number of times like I will declare

15
01:09.090 --> 01:12.180
some variable integer i

16
01:12.490 --> 01:14.270
And that is assigned to zero.

17
01:14.520 --> 01:16.840
No I want to say while.

18
01:16.890 --> 01:18.640
I less than 10.

19
01:18.990 --> 01:21.360
OK as long as I use less than 10.

20
01:21.360 --> 01:22.650
It should display Hello.

21
01:23.070 --> 01:24.050
Let us run and see

22
01:26.940 --> 01:28.490
see more than 10 times.

23
01:28.550 --> 01:32.150
It's going on repeating again it is infinite.

24
01:32.270 --> 01:33.660
It's not stopping.

25
01:33.860 --> 01:36.970
I should stop forcibly here by clicking here.

26
01:37.090 --> 01:38.660
I have stopped it.

27
01:38.660 --> 01:39.890
Why it is not stopping.

28
01:39.890 --> 01:40.880
What is the reason.

29
01:40.880 --> 01:42.480
See I value 0.

30
01:42.530 --> 01:45.910
I is less than 10 yes always zero is less than 10.

31
01:46.060 --> 01:47.040
Going on printing.

32
01:47.050 --> 01:47.600
Hello.

33
01:48.020 --> 01:52.330
So what I should do I should modify so that it reaches a 10.

34
01:52.340 --> 01:54.840
So for that purpose I will write.

35
01:54.890 --> 01:55.730
i Plus plus.

36
01:56.150 --> 02:00.150
Yes now it will print hello for 10 times.

37
02:00.170 --> 02:01.680
I start from zero.

38
02:01.880 --> 02:06.170
I will stop at ten and it will continue till 9.

39
02:06.370 --> 02:07.400
Let us run this

40
02:10.500 --> 02:11.180
yeah.

41
02:11.580 --> 02:14.460
No it has printed just hello 10 times.

42
02:14.640 --> 02:18.330
So the point that we have learned here is whatever the condition is written here.

43
02:18.330 --> 02:23.850
That must become false at some point otherwise it enters into infinite loop.

44
02:23.920 --> 02:33.380
Debug this program and show you so for that I'll put break point here and I will run the program.

45
02:33.900 --> 02:38.890
Now here you can see that value of i is double three two three four.

46
02:39.060 --> 02:43.470
So that is some garbage number and it has dropped at this point I will press

47
02:43.510 --> 02:45.790
F7 function F 7.

48
02:45.990 --> 02:50.570
Now I is zero here if you can see this  i is zero.

49
02:51.090 --> 03:00.270
And I is less than 10 so it will enter insidet and print hello then I plus plus it's not yet executed.

50
03:00.290 --> 03:01.010
F7.

51
03:01.010 --> 03:06.910
Now I became one and it has jumped on to this one and it is less than 10.

52
03:06.980 --> 03:08.290
Press f7.

53
03:09.980 --> 03:19.770
Now I pluss Plus I becomes two I is changing to two, then  I become three, i is four.

54
03:20.000 --> 03:23.260
So you can check the value of I that is 4.

55
03:23.810 --> 03:26.320
Then go on repeating it.

56
03:26.360 --> 03:33.070
I am repeating it by pressing f7 function F 7 so I's 8 now.

57
03:33.260 --> 03:37.790
And I is 9 and now I value is 9.

58
03:37.790 --> 03:46.090
You can check here I value is 9 and it is the showing here in the watch window and then I became 10

59
03:46.370 --> 03:48.640
and then this not less than 10.

60
03:48.670 --> 03:50.210
So it will come up.

61
03:50.740 --> 03:51.190
That's it.

62
03:51.190 --> 03:58.410
So in this way with the help of debugger you can see every statement How it is executing.

63
03:58.480 --> 04:07.360
So this is while loop I'll remove the break point delete break point same thing I can do it using do

64
04:07.360 --> 04:08.640
while loop also.

65
04:08.800 --> 04:16.540
I will remove this and say do and here I will  say i is less than ten and semi-colon and

66
04:16.540 --> 04:20.470
also after hello let us give slash n enter a new line.

67
04:20.470 --> 04:23.070
Now let us run the program and see.

68
04:23.830 --> 04:32.760
Yes it is spending hello for 10 times. is a really 10 times? what I will do is before.

69
04:32.770 --> 04:33.340
Hello.

70
04:33.390 --> 04:39.210
I will print the value of i also and I'll give some space before.

71
04:39.220 --> 04:40.000
Hello.

72
04:40.310 --> 04:42.400
Let us run it again.

73
04:44.810 --> 04:52.920
Yes it is from zero to 9 so it is 10 times it is printing Hello.

74
04:52.980 --> 04:56.600
So the same program can be written using the do while loop also.

75
04:56.610 --> 04:58.890
Now let me show you for loop.

76
04:59.610 --> 05:01.740
Same thing right.

77
05:01.770 --> 05:10.980
Same thing i will write, for integer I assign 0 and I is less than 10 I plus plus

78
05:14.450 --> 05:16.190
I have already decleared I there.

79
05:16.200 --> 05:18.060
So I should remove i from here.

80
05:18.240 --> 05:22.420
So inside the for loop only is declare, here I will say cout.

81
05:23.290 --> 05:31.870
Then here I will say cout I then space hello and slash.

82
05:32.340 --> 05:41.520
It's the same thing see inside for loop this declaration and initialization and the condition that we were

83
05:41.520 --> 05:45.550
using in while and Increment and that we were using inside.

84
05:45.660 --> 05:46.900
while and do while.

85
05:47.070 --> 05:53.490
That all came in a single line because I is used as a counter so all the things related to a counter

86
05:53.490 --> 05:56.360
are done in a single bracket.

87
05:56.400 --> 06:00.000
So this is easy for reading and everything is at one place.

88
06:00.120 --> 06:03.620
Let us run the program and see what happens.

89
06:04.040 --> 06:04.940
Yeah is printing hello.

90
06:04.950 --> 06:09.330
Hello from zero to nine so total 10 times it is printing Hello.

91
06:09.600 --> 06:16.950
Let us put a break point and run the program, so now i will  go on pressing F 7.

92
06:16.950 --> 06:25.770
So you can see that it is displaying one by one and I begin four and five six seven.

93
06:25.920 --> 06:29.310
So it will not show these as seperate step.

94
06:29.310 --> 06:35.170
It will show it as a single line only after printing hello it will go to this for loop line.

95
06:35.380 --> 06:41.970
And in this it will increment the value and then check the condition then it will come inside now

96
06:41.970 --> 06:52.380
the value of i is seven then eight then printed and then nine and printed and not ten.

97
06:52.380 --> 06:53.710
It has stopped.

98
06:53.730 --> 06:56.300
So when I became 10 and it had stopped.

99
06:56.310 --> 07:01.140
So the same piece of code I have shown you using while loop and for loop and do while loop.

100
07:01.200 --> 07:04.340
So it can be done using all three loops.

101
07:04.350 --> 07:08.010
So try this one sample program you can try it on your computer.
