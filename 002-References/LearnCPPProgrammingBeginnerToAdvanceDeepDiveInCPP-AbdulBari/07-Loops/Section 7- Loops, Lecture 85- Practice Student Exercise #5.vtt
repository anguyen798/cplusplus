Here is an exercise program that you have to write this program is from the user and you have to reverse

1
00:05.670 --> 00:10.830
it and check after reversing if the number is same than it is as palindrome.

2
00:11.100 --> 00:14.930
You have to check whether a given number is a palindrome or not.

3
00:14.940 --> 00:20.220
So here I'll show you how the program should run and what should be the input and what should be

4
00:20.210 --> 00:20.740
o/p

5
00:21.090 --> 00:23.620
And even the program file is given As pdf

6
00:23.640 --> 00:31.680
So if you face any difficulty in writing the program you can check that program code. let me run the program

7
00:31.710 --> 00:34.850
for checking whether a number is a palindrome or not.

8
00:34.860 --> 00:41.550
I will run the program here is asking for any positive numbers so I'll give the number that is 1 2 3

9
00:41.820 --> 00:46.740
so it will reverse the numbers so reversing 3 2 1 is not same as 1 2 3.

10
00:46.740 --> 00:53.140
So number is the reverse of a number is 3 2 1 and the number is not a palindrome.

11
00:53.160 --> 00:54.440
So this is the message I got.

12
00:54.480 --> 01:00.850
I will run the program once again and I'll give the input as of 1 2 3 and 2 1.

13
01:00.930 --> 01:05.580
So the reverse of the number is same as the number so it should be a palindrome.

14
01:05.580 --> 01:07.150
So let us check the output.

15
01:07.290 --> 01:12.540
So it says that reverse of the number is so-and-so and number is a palindrome.

16
01:12.540 --> 01:15.040
So here I got the message that it's a palindrome.

17
01:15.180 --> 01:20.160
So alreadsy we know how to take out the digits of a number so you can take out the digits of a number and based

18
01:20.160 --> 01:24.420
on that you can reverse a number and once the number is reversed.

19
01:24.420 --> 01:27.390
You can check that there is a palindrome or not

20
01:27.420 --> 01:32.970
So the logic that is using loop you have to write down this code I mean focus on the program is to write

21
01:32.970 --> 01:36.330
the logic in the loop for reversing a number .

22
01:36.420 --> 01:40.200
So try this program and even pdf is available for the program.
