00:00.420 --> 00:08.100
Let us write a  program to take a number and display digits of a number one by one.

1
00:08.220 --> 00:19.500
So for that I am taking a variable n here, and here and I'll give a message "enter a number" then cin take a

2
00:19.500 --> 00:21.160
number from the keyboard in variable n.

3
00:21.210 --> 00:29.330
now How we can take out a digit from a number is I can take the remainder.

4
00:30.250 --> 00:33.250
So for that I'll go up and declare one more variable .

5
00:33.300 --> 00:37.610
that is a remainder.

6
00:37.650 --> 00:39.800
Now this can be done using a loop.

7
00:39.940 --> 00:46.400
While n is not equal to zero means it should stop when n becomes equal to zero.

8
00:46.620 --> 00:48.020
That's what I should do every time

9
00:48.060 --> 00:58.140
is reminder r assign n Mod 10, if you perform mod operation using 10 than I will get the last digit

10
00:58.140 --> 01:05.490
of a number then number should be divided by 10.

11
01:05.770 --> 01:10.630
cout r that's it.

12
01:10.740 --> 01:17.850
Outside the loop I will say cout endl to give a new line.

13
01:17.960 --> 01:26.480
Let us run this program here its asking for a number I will give a number that is 2 3 5.

14
01:26.490 --> 01:30.750
See I got that number as 5 and 3 and 2.

15
01:31.650 --> 01:40.080
Now here inside the code after displaying a remainder I'll give endL So every digit i will get it

16
01:40.080 --> 01:47.800
in a new line, enter a number: 8 7 3.

17
01:47.980 --> 01:50.410
So I get 3 7 8.

18
01:50.530 --> 01:53.900
So I'm getting individual digits of a number.

19
01:54.220 --> 02:00.320
So it is starting from the last digit next.

20
02:00.620 --> 02:06.730
So this a program for displaying digits of a number one by one starting from the last digit instead

21
02:06.730 --> 02:07.900
of displaying digits.

22
02:07.900 --> 02:17.560
What I do is I add all the digits of the number so far that I should declare one variable sum and that

23
02:17.560 --> 02:19.060
is initialized to zero.

24
02:19.240 --> 02:31.780
And every time I should store r in sum, there is end of loop I will say sum I'll just display sum.

25
02:31.780 --> 02:33.660
Let us see what i will get.

26
02:35.530 --> 02:41.240
If a number is 2 3 5 then the sum of these digits is two plus three plus five.

27
02:41.870 --> 02:45.980
is 10 let us see, Yeah they got the correct answer.

28
02:46.180 --> 02:51.300
So it is displaying sum of the digits of a number.

29
02:51.550 --> 02:59.020
I will run once again, now i will give the digits as 1 2 and 9 so that some will be 12.

30
02:59.110 --> 02:59.590
Yes.

31
02:59.590 --> 03:01.110
I got the answer as 12.

32
03:01.480 --> 03:06.200
So this is showing the sum of the digits of a number.

33
03:06.610 --> 03:15.830
The one thing I do is, when ever I am adding remainder, I'll multiply this sum by ten and then add

34
03:16.490 --> 03:19.310
let us see what happens to our number.

35
03:22.950 --> 03:31.230
If I give a number as 1 3 4 so i got 431 as a single number.

36
03:31.640 --> 03:35.510
Let us try again with another number.

37
03:35.670 --> 03:38.680
Now the number is 7 3 9.

38
03:38.720 --> 03:42.480
So I got 9 3 7.

39
03:42.790 --> 03:46.680
Whenever I am adding remainder, i'm multiplying the sum value by 10.

40
03:46.680 --> 03:49.340
So this is giving me reverse of a number.

41
03:49.410 --> 03:53.970
So just for name sake I will change the variable name as rev.

42
03:53.970 --> 03:57.780
So this is not sum this is a reverse of a number.

43
03:57.810 --> 04:01.080
So this is the logic for reverse of a number.

44
04:01.150 --> 04:02.420
Now i will give you a exercise here.

45
04:02.460 --> 04:05.930
You take a number and display a number in words.

46
04:05.940 --> 04:15.750
For example if you are giving number 245 then it should display two four five, it should display it in words

47
04:15.900 --> 04:17.340
two four five.

48
04:17.730 --> 04:23.560
So hint here is that you can take out the last digit five and then four then and two.

49
04:23.580 --> 04:29.910
So you can take out like this so you'll be if you want you can display those numbers in words by using

50
04:29.910 --> 04:30.850
switch case.

51
04:30.870 --> 04:32.490
So which you have already seen.

52
04:32.520 --> 04:43.140
So whatever the remainder you are getting you can see Case 1 then cout one and break.

53
04:43.430 --> 04:52.770
So like this you can make cases for all the digits so it will display a word for each digit.

54
04:53.190 --> 04:58.720
But the problem here is that if I do it in this loop then I'll be getting the digits from the backside.

55
04:58.950 --> 05:04.260
Then what I should do I should reverse the number and then again take out digits of a rev number

56
05:04.260 --> 05:06.610
number and display it in words.

57
05:06.780 --> 05:11.850
So this is an exercise for you and you can try this program by yourself.
