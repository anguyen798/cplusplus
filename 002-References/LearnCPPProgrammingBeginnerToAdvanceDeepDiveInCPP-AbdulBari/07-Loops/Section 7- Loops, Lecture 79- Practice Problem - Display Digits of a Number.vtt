00:00.630 --> 00:07.260
In this video we will learn about displaying the digits of a number from reverse.

1
00:08.160 --> 00:14.250
If any number is given then we are going to display the digits now compared to the previous topics.

2
00:14.250 --> 00:17.150
Previous videos if you see there is a change in the procedure.

3
00:17.160 --> 00:18.780
Little change in the procedure.

4
00:18.890 --> 00:25.510
And based on this procedure we are going to see a couple of problems on this one so let us start the

5
00:25.510 --> 00:30.020
topic see there is a number here 1 7 2 4.

6
00:30.060 --> 00:33.960
We want to display 4 2 7 1.

7
00:34.860 --> 00:36.760
So how to change it.

8
00:36.760 --> 00:38.190
How to get the values from there.

9
00:38.620 --> 00:45.130
So we should get the value 4 separately two separately 7 and 1 each digit we want separately.

10
00:45.130 --> 00:46.340
How do we get the digits.

11
00:46.340 --> 00:51.370
Let us see see the number is 1 7 2 4.

12
00:51.370 --> 00:53.450
I want to get the last digit.

13
00:53.530 --> 00:56.030
How we can get the last digit.

14
00:56.140 --> 01:01.620
So if I take mod by ten you get the last digit.

15
01:02.040 --> 01:03.670
So remember this, this logic.

16
01:03.670 --> 01:04.450
You remember this.

17
01:04.470 --> 01:07.150
This procedure,  if any number is there.

18
01:07.290 --> 01:15.300
You perform mod 1 7 2 4 mod 10 this number gets divided about 10 and the remainder is 4.

19
01:15.300 --> 01:20.260
So this gives the remainder four that so you can get a digit.

20
01:20.320 --> 01:21.930
How are you going to get two.

21
01:22.170 --> 01:24.780
So you can't get two now right.

22
01:24.780 --> 01:31.020
If you're mod by 100 you'll get 24 you will not get two for getting that two let us make two as

23
01:31.020 --> 01:32.280
the last digit.

24
01:32.370 --> 01:36.460
How to Make two as a last digit remove four, how to remove four.

25
01:37.530 --> 01:45.700
1 7 2 4 divided by 10 divided by ten is 1 7 2. 4.

26
01:45.700 --> 01:53.130
No no integer division you remember integer division will truncate that decimal part and it gives

27
01:53.310 --> 01:55.180
1 7 2.

28
01:56.010 --> 01:56.940
That's it.

29
01:56.940 --> 02:02.800
So now the number has reduced to one hundred and seventy two it was one thousand seven hundred twenty 

30
02:02.830 --> 02:03.090
four.

31
02:03.100 --> 02:05.220
No it is one hundred and seventy two.

32
02:05.280 --> 02:07.060
So you have two at the last.

33
02:07.620 --> 02:10.930
How to get two again mod by 10.

34
02:11.010 --> 02:15.430
again  od by 10 again the number of will be reduced when you divide it by 10.

35
02:15.540 --> 02:18.330
So this way we can take out the digits one by one.

36
02:18.330 --> 02:23.300
So yes that procedure I have shown here this is the basic idea I gave you.

37
02:23.310 --> 02:25.980
No let us do it as a procedure let us do it.

38
02:26.400 --> 02:28.650
This is a no.

39
02:28.680 --> 02:34.070
How do get four, perform n mod ten and take it as a remainder.

40
02:34.290 --> 02:39.130
So this is a remainder, remainder is four right. first time remainder is 4.

41
02:39.300 --> 02:46.350
How did you get this 172 change the number to 172 so divide the number by 10 and make it as a number

42
02:46.350 --> 02:47.440
only again.

43
02:47.460 --> 02:48.790
Again no.

44
02:48.810 --> 02:56.940
Now in the next step it is 172 mod by ten, we get last digit 2 then divide the number 172 by

45
02:57.210 --> 03:05.370
by ten so it becomes seventeen then in the next step seventeen mod ten seven seventeen divided

46
03:05.370 --> 03:08.890
by ten= one the next step.

47
03:08.890 --> 03:11.660
That one is carried, that one mod 10

48
03:11.690 --> 03:17.820
it is one, one divided by 10, 0 times, the remainder is one.

49
03:17.950 --> 03:21.700
Then divide one by 10 0 times 0.

50
03:21.760 --> 03:23.540
Now this became zero stop.

51
03:23.830 --> 03:25.980
So next step if you see the number is zero.

52
03:26.050 --> 03:26.690
So stop.

53
03:27.520 --> 03:33.190
So this is how we can perform the steps repeatedly and we can get the digits from the end of a number

54
03:33.190 --> 03:35.250
from the right hand side of a number.

55
03:35.560 --> 03:40.090
And we can display them, just we want digits right from right side or left side.

56
03:40.090 --> 03:41.430
Doesn't matter which want digits.

57
03:41.470 --> 03:45.470
So we got the digits that are 4 2 7 1.

58
03:45.570 --> 03:46.460
That's it.

59
03:46.490 --> 03:48.410
Let us see the flow chart for that one.

60
03:48.420 --> 03:51.340
Already I have a flow chart flow chart starts.

61
03:51.350 --> 03:52.340
Let us take a number.

62
03:52.610 --> 03:54.960
Let us see them what is 1 7 2 4.

63
03:55.080 --> 03:58.640
this is repeating.

64
03:58.640 --> 04:02.880
So this is using a loop, using a loop, which loop we will see afterwards.

65
04:03.350 --> 04:09.260
If n is a greater than 0 yes we have to stop, run and  become 0 so if n is greater than zero

66
04:09.520 --> 04:09.980
if

67
04:10.000 --> 04:12.610
True there are two things you have to do.

68
04:12.720 --> 04:20.450
take mod as a remainder,  divide the number by 10 reduce it by removing larger digit reduce

69
04:20.510 --> 04:20.970
this one.

70
04:21.530 --> 04:28.520
Then these numbers we want to print them. so print them, after printing  continue again check if the number

71
04:28.520 --> 04:32.950
is greater than zero again perform these two again and again continue continue.

72
04:33.050 --> 04:33.760
How long.

73
04:33.830 --> 04:37.590
As long as n is  greater than zero when to stop? when n becomes zero.

74
04:37.940 --> 04:41.870
So if n has became zero means it's not a greater than zero falls.

75
04:41.870 --> 04:43.470
So stop.

76
04:43.480 --> 04:44.450
This is the procedure.

77
04:44.450 --> 04:48.850
So this is how we can mod and divide and print.

78
04:49.100 --> 04:52.220
So these are steps we have to write three steps are there in a loop.

79
04:52.220 --> 04:54.780
These are the processing part and this is the printing part.

80
04:54.830 --> 04:58.730
so output so these three steps are there inside a loop.

81
04:58.720 --> 05:03.120
Right now is it using for loop.

82
05:03.260 --> 05:10.190
We have already seen few programs previously in the previous videos there I was there counter was there

83
05:10.430 --> 05:11.360
is there any content.

84
05:11.780 --> 05:13.380
No no.

85
05:13.580 --> 05:15.900
can i write using for loop also? yes.

86
05:16.070 --> 05:16.970
Shall I write.

87
05:16.970 --> 05:17.270
No.

88
05:17.300 --> 05:18.670
Don't write it.

89
05:18.810 --> 05:19.300
for means

90
05:19.310 --> 05:21.930
If you have the number of times then use it it's better.

91
05:22.360 --> 05:24.680
So how to write this one while or do while.

92
05:24.930 --> 05:28.840
So okay I will use while loop, let us write it using while loop.

93
05:28.910 --> 05:36.290
So start take one no. read a number, is already there, how many variables are required n and r

94
05:36.470 --> 05:37.700
only two variables required.

95
05:38.140 --> 05:42.520
n and r then this is the beginning of the loop condition is there.

96
05:42.530 --> 05:44.660
So what is the condition while.

97
05:46.100 --> 05:47.480
n is greater than zero.

98
05:47.870 --> 05:48.690
OK.

99
05:48.830 --> 05:50.620
If I write > 0 what to do.

100
05:50.630 --> 05:53.630
Find out remainder and divide that number by 10.

101
05:53.630 --> 06:01.430
Find out the remainder n mod 10 and divide the number by ten and divided by ten then what

102
06:01.430 --> 06:02.010
to do.

103
06:02.130 --> 06:02.780
Print that r.

104
06:02.840 --> 06:05.300
so I will use a c out

105
06:08.120 --> 06:14.970
and after this I give endl so that every digit comes in the next line so I should get the o/p like these

106
06:14.990 --> 06:17.900
this 4 first then two then 7 then 1.

107
06:18.020 --> 06:22.090
Then after this close again it goes to while.

108
06:22.340 --> 06:27.850
So close this loop then there is nothing after that to close the program.

109
06:27.860 --> 06:36.110
So here you have to write return zero you know it well, this is the program for displaying the digits of a

110
06:36.110 --> 06:38.720
number from reverse.

111
06:38.720 --> 06:40.230
So this is the program.

112
06:40.280 --> 06:45.110
There is a coding exercise available for this one complete that and also demo is there so

113
06:45.110 --> 06:50.630
can watch that demo and  write the program by yourself on your P.C. like a complete program and check

114
06:50.630 --> 06:50.840
it.

115
06:50.930 --> 06:52.530
So is the basics of programming.

116
06:52.670 --> 06:57.980
If you are used to this one, if you are good in this one then you can solve new problems by yourself.

117
06:57.980 --> 06:59.740
New programs you can write down right.

118
07:00.080 --> 07:02.360
And not just one time if possible.

119
07:02.360 --> 07:07.820
I write this program more than one time so that you could be able to write it without taking any help.

120
07:07.850 --> 07:13.310
You should be able to write the program by yourself so this doesn't come just by one time so do it again

121
07:13.310 --> 07:14.470
and again right.

122
07:14.530 --> 07:16.760
So whenever you are free, you try the program.

123
07:17.000 --> 07:23.480
So if you want to learn programming you have to spend more time in practice. now in the next video.

124
07:23.480 --> 07:28.920
The topic will be using same procedure so I will not remove this.

125
07:29.000 --> 07:30.370
It will be as it is.

126
07:30.410 --> 07:33.220
So let us look at our next program and next video.
