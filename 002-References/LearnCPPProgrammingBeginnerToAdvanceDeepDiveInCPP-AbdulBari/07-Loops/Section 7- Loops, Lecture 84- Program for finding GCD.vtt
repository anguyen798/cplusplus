Let us write a program to find  gcd of two numbers. for that and I'm taking two variables m and n

1
00:06.790 --> 00:18.480
then cout i will say enter 2 numbers then cin taking two numbers.

2
00:18.970 --> 00:23.220
m and n. now logic already we know how to do that.

3
00:23.220 --> 00:33.210
So we have to go on subtracting either n from m or m from n until they both  becomes equal.

4
00:33.210 --> 00:36.670
So while m is not equal to n.

5
00:36.750 --> 00:48.920
if M is greater than n, IF m  is  a greater value, then from m subtract n and and store the value in m only

6
00:48.950 --> 00:50.100
...

7
00:52.770 --> 01:07.320
else if n is greater than m and n is a greater number than in n subtract m from n then store

8
01:07.320 --> 01:07.970
the result in 

9
01:08.040 --> 01:11.460
n, once they become equal they will stop.

10
01:11.580 --> 01:13.490
So if they're not equal you will continue.

11
01:13.530 --> 01:18.610
If they're not equal this condition will be true if they are equal the condition will be false and loop

12
01:18.620 --> 01:19.730
will stop.

13
01:19.870 --> 01:27.450
And after this loop we will say cout now either m or n both of them are having the answer the actual

14
01:27.450 --> 01:29.470
numbers m and n are lost.

15
01:29.520 --> 01:30.900
We have decreased them right.

16
01:30.900 --> 01:32.990
We have made them both of them equal.

17
01:33.180 --> 01:37.580
So simply I will give a message that is gcd is.

18
01:37.650 --> 01:39.130
We don't have original numbers.

19
01:39.150 --> 01:46.040
If you want to preserve original number then you can take them in some other variables before running off

20
01:46.230 --> 01:47.360
loop.

21
01:47.370 --> 01:49.520
So this is GCD.

22
01:49.650 --> 01:53.160
Let us run the program and see.

23
01:54.150 --> 01:56.430
I'll give 2 numbers 21.

24
01:56.460 --> 02:11.180
So 7 is a factor of 21 and 35 7 is a factor of 35,  see 7 is gcd is the answer.

25
02:11.970 --> 02:15.920
Let me try once more and give some different numbers.

26
02:15.930 --> 02:17.150
Heere i will write endl

27
02:20.180 --> 02:21.680
now here two numbers.

28
02:21.700 --> 02:24.580
I'll give nine.

29
02:24.580 --> 02:27.640
So factor is three.

30
02:27.650 --> 02:33.990
One factor is three as well as 7 seven so the common highest factor is three.

31
02:34.000 --> 02:39.580
So yes GCD is three.

32
02:39.820 --> 02:40.370
That's it.

33
02:40.450 --> 02:42.360
You can try this program by yourself.
