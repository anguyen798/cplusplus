let us write a  program to find the gcd or greatest common divisor of two numbers.  suppose I have two numbers m is

1
00:09.480 --> 00:13.990
30 and n is  21.

2
00:14.010 --> 00:16.150
Now let me repeat how we can,

3
00:16.180 --> 00:19.920
Let us re-learn that how GCD can be found for  2 number.

4
00:19.920 --> 00:29.600
So if I have two numbers m and n, what we can do is, out of these two numbers whichever number is greater.

5
00:29.690 --> 00:30.860
See this thirty is great.

6
00:30.870 --> 00:31.930
And this is smaller.

7
00:32.040 --> 00:34.950
So subtract smaller number from the greater number.

8
00:34.950 --> 00:37.620
So this becomes 30 minus 21.

9
00:37.620 --> 00:43.590
This is 9 and this is 21 now we have nine here nine and 21 which is greater.

10
00:43.590 --> 00:44.190
This is greater.

11
00:44.190 --> 00:48.420
So subtract the smaller number from that one  21 minus nine gives 12.

12
00:48.490 --> 00:53.970
And this is 9 really still this number is smaller and this is a greater So subtract smaller number from

13
00:53.970 --> 00:54.750
the greater numbers.

14
00:54.760 --> 00:59.150
What is this 12 minus 9 is 3 and this is 9 only.

15
00:59.150 --> 01:01.610
Now this time this is greater than that smaller.

16
01:01.620 --> 01:04.750
So subtract 9-3 is 6.

17
01:04.800 --> 01:09.690
And this is three only, this is  three as it is now 6 and 3.

18
01:09.690 --> 01:10.300
This is great.

19
01:10.300 --> 01:13.140
And so 6 minus 3 is a 3.

20
01:13.200 --> 01:18.510
And this is 3 so no we have reached a stage where both the numbers are equal.

21
01:18.510 --> 01:26.120
So therefore this is the gcd that is the greatest common divisor our highest common factor of two numbers.

22
01:26.130 --> 01:30.530
So the common factor of thirty and 21 is three.

23
01:30.540 --> 01:36.610
So the procedure is you have to subtract the smaller number from the greater number whichever is greater

24
01:36.610 --> 01:38.990
which are a smaller check it and subtract it.

25
01:39.120 --> 01:43.660
So we have to go on doing it until both the numbers become equal.

26
01:44.150 --> 01:46.500
At least they will become equal to 1

27
01:47.010 --> 01:50.710
If you are taking two prime no.s then they  will reduse down to finally one.

28
01:50.730 --> 01:56.310
So you have to continue the procedure as long as these two are different when these two becomes equal

29
01:56.310 --> 01:56.990
we should stop.

30
01:57.000 --> 01:59.590
So now, right now m is 3 and n is also three.

31
01:59.610 --> 02:00.710
So we should stop.

32
02:00.960 --> 02:04.380
So here I read on the program I need 2 numbers.

33
02:04.790 --> 02:05.490
m & n.

34
02:05.790 --> 02:18.690
So we take two numbers from keyboard Enter two numbers, cin m and n. now what should I

35
02:18.690 --> 02:32.760
do is if m is greater then n then from m subtract n and store the result in m only else if

36
02:32.760 --> 02:36.110
then n>m then from n  subtract m.

37
02:36.180 --> 02:39.240
And store the result in n.

38
02:39.240 --> 02:47.520
So these two statements I have to go on repeating how long,  while m is not equal to n.

39
02:47.890 --> 02:51.360
So where i should stop when they are equal, I should stop.

40
02:51.360 --> 02:56.060
So how long i should continue as long as they are not equal i should Continue.

41
02:56.160 --> 03:02.510
So once they are equals it will stop and here I can display GCD of two numbers that is m.

42
03:02.520 --> 03:08.660
And so there are a lot of programs that you can go and some of the programs are in exercises so do those

43
03:08.820 --> 03:09.000
by yourself.
