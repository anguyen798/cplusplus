00:00.660 --> 00:05.270
Now let us write a program for finding factorial of number.

1
00:05.430 --> 00:10.350
This will be similar to the previous program that is finding the sum of first n national numbers.

2
00:10.350 --> 00:15.030
So let us understand what does it mean by factorial then how we can solve a problem.

3
00:15.030 --> 00:18.520
Let us understand the procedure and flowchart and program.

4
00:18.570 --> 00:21.470
So first what does it mean by Factorial.

5
00:21.690 --> 00:27.740
If I have a number six integer no. it should not be a decimal like six point five six point four.

6
00:27.870 --> 00:34.440
It should be integral number factorial of that number means product of first  n natural numbers that

7
00:34.440 --> 00:38.550
is up to 6 1 into two into 3 into 4 into 5 into 6.

8
00:38.550 --> 00:39.700
That is factorial.

9
00:39.720 --> 00:42.000
It is written like this, this is the symbol.

10
00:42.090 --> 00:43.700
Now how much is the product of that.

11
00:43.740 --> 00:46.000
Up to 6 It is 7 20.

12
00:46.170 --> 00:49.770
So we have to take one multiplied by 2 then multiply it by three.

13
00:49.800 --> 00:51.300
This is repeating right.

14
00:51.300 --> 00:57.270
This is repeating yes when it is repeating then we can use a loop but we have to do it using loop.

15
00:57.840 --> 01:03.210
So how does repeating or understand that I have data here in the form of a table.

16
01:03.240 --> 01:08.970
So the procedure I have in and it step by step I have broken down something in two steps so that I see

17
01:09.420 --> 01:12.590
here I have no 1 2 3 4 5 6, oh

18
01:12.600 --> 01:13.490
this is the counter.

19
01:13.920 --> 01:15.280
We are familiar with the counter.

20
01:15.420 --> 01:16.070
Yes.

21
01:16.110 --> 01:20.360
So let us call it as i,  that I use is starting from 1 onwards.

22
01:20.400 --> 01:21.450
Yes.

23
01:21.520 --> 01:23.430
Then what is happening this side.

24
01:23.550 --> 01:26.750
See what is multiplied by one, the result is one.

25
01:26.790 --> 01:32.760
That one is taken here one into two the result two. 2  is taken down here then two is multiplied by three

26
01:32.760 --> 01:36.020
to six and six is taken here after this.

27
01:36.210 --> 01:41.780
Three four, six is multiplied by four, the result is twenty four is taken so next step.

28
01:41.880 --> 01:43.200
And this four becomes five.

29
01:43.830 --> 01:44.950
So this is multiplied.

30
01:45.020 --> 01:47.210
The result here and this is multiplied.

31
01:47.760 --> 01:54.150
So it means every time i is multiplied with the value there and the result is stored in that value only.

32
01:54.390 --> 01:56.300
So let us call this as factorial.

33
01:56.400 --> 01:57.760
So what is happening here.

34
01:57.900 --> 02:03.910
Factorial is multiplied by I understand it is stored in factorial.

35
02:04.530 --> 02:07.590
So initially what was the value of factorial.

36
02:07.590 --> 02:14.100
So I should have a variable called factorial in that the value should be 1 then multiplied by 1 

37
02:14.100 --> 02:18.950
result is one then that factorial is still 1 then it becomes two then Factorial  become 2

38
02:18.950 --> 02:25.000
then factorial  become 6 factorial become 24 then 120 and finally the 720.

39
02:25.280 --> 02:28.600
And here if you have the 1 2 3 4 5 6 that is a counter .

40
02:30.180 --> 02:36.700
So we can see that these two steps if I perform them repeatedly from 1 to 6 I get the result.

41
02:36.920 --> 02:40.610
Well let us look at the flow chart here again the similar thing.

42
02:40.650 --> 02:42.790
I have a start and  read no.

43
02:43.050 --> 02:48.290
Then I assign one factorial assign one these two are initialized then this is the same thing only

44
02:48.290 --> 02:49.760
we have seen it previously.

45
02:49.830 --> 02:56.640
The difference here is a factorial is multiplied by I and I is incremented this is repeated as long

46
02:56.640 --> 03:03.570
as it is less than equal to N and where it is greater than n false it will come out and print the factorial

47
03:03.600 --> 03:04.600
then stop.

48
03:04.650 --> 03:09.480
So that differs from the previous program to this program is, there we were adding here we are multiplying

49
03:09.850 --> 03:11.050
and that's it.

50
03:11.070 --> 03:17.250
So let us write  down a program for this one I have some variables already declared here and i infact if you

51
03:17.250 --> 03:22.150
read here n I in fact these are the variables used.

52
03:22.470 --> 03:27.820
So if you observe here n, i,  fact three variables are used,  so I have declared them then read

53
03:27.820 --> 03:34.430
the value of n then, this reputation can be done using for loop right this is the counter control.

54
03:34.590 --> 03:44.220
So for I start from 1 onwards I should be less than equal to N and I plus plus not everything is happening

55
03:44.220 --> 03:47.120
inside this for only this production part.

56
03:47.220 --> 03:48.190
This is finished.

57
03:48.210 --> 03:49.030
This is finished.

58
03:49.030 --> 03:50.050
This is finished.

59
03:50.640 --> 03:53.670
Only this product part should be inside the loop.

60
03:53.670 --> 04:01.660
So fact multiply assign i also I can write, instead of writing like this fact aside factor and

61
04:01.720 --> 04:07.590
why even I can relate to compound assignment statement and I can write it like this that's all.

62
04:08.010 --> 04:13.520
So this becomes very simple outside the loop at the end I should bring the factorial.

63
04:13.650 --> 04:26.550
So here I will give you a proper message I'll give a message that factorial of then n, then again

64
04:26.610 --> 04:36.540
here is then fact is a variable, in this i got the answer, that's all, return so and so.

65
04:36.650 --> 04:37.430
How the output looks like.

66
04:37.550 --> 04:49.910
It looks like, output will be, factorial of what is n, it is a six so six is as I should give some

67
04:49.910 --> 04:54.120
spaces right before i and after s I should give space then fact.

68
04:54.170 --> 04:55.700
So I'm getting the result here.

69
04:55.730 --> 04:59.670
If n is six then answer is seven twenty will be displayed.

70
04:59.740 --> 05:04.110
This is more meaningful message factorial of Six Seven twenty.

71
05:04.500 --> 05:05.690
One more thing you can do.

72
05:05.990 --> 05:09.230
You can say cout instead of this one right.

73
05:09.270 --> 05:18.770
Instead of this one cout and n  then in double quotes exclamation and equal to sign close this one and

74
05:18.900 --> 05:20.450
safe fact.

75
05:20.450 --> 05:24.710
So what will be the output n means 6 then after that this exclamation.

76
05:24.890 --> 05:31.170
Six factorial is equal to fact is how much 720 you get o/p like this.

77
05:31.240 --> 05:34.260
instead of giving a message like this you can write this one also.

78
05:34.520 --> 05:37.200
So anyone of this you can use.

79
05:37.520 --> 05:41.780
So that's all just for the simple program for finding the factorial.

80
05:41.780 --> 05:46.110
And there is a coding exercise available you have to write on this loop part right.

81
05:46.160 --> 05:50.750
You have to write on the loop part and also you can practice this program.

82
05:50.750 --> 05:54.360
There is a demo is also available so fast you practice it right by yourself.

83
05:54.360 --> 05:56.150
Everything is there here on board.

84
05:56.150 --> 05:59.130
You can note down and you can practice on your machine.

85
05:59.450 --> 06:04.760
If you get any problem if you face any problem you can check out the demo video and PDF is also there.

86
06:04.760 --> 06:07.820
Still if you have any problem you can give a message to me right.

87
06:07.850 --> 06:10.160
I'll quickly reply to your message.

88
06:10.250 --> 06:11.280
That's all in this video.
