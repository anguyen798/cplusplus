00:00.720 --> 00:08.250
In this video we write a program for finding the sum of first natural numbers.

1
00:08.250 --> 00:10.560
First of all, i will explain what does it mean.

2
00:10.590 --> 00:12.190
What is the problem.

3
00:12.240 --> 00:17.310
Then I'll explain to you how we can take an approach how we can design a procedure for it.

4
00:17.310 --> 00:18.640
Then we will see the flow chart.

5
00:18.650 --> 00:19.980
I have already written it.

6
00:20.040 --> 00:21.170
Then we will write the program.

7
00:21.750 --> 00:25.610
So let us understand what is sum of First n natural number.

8
00:25.620 --> 00:27.770
See the natural numbers starts from 1 onwards.

9
00:27.780 --> 00:34.800
So 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 up to 9 means 1- 9 First 9 natural numbers.

10
00:34.800 --> 00:35.850
I want to find the sum.

11
00:36.600 --> 00:39.230
So id I add all of them it is 45.

12
00:39.450 --> 00:41.520
So there is a direct formula for this one.

13
00:41.520 --> 00:47.450
That is the formula is n into n plus one by 2 in one of the video we have seen this one right.

14
00:47.820 --> 00:52.900
So this is sum of the first n national numbers but here we don't want to use the formula.

15
00:53.100 --> 00:56.370
We want to use a loop and write this one.

16
00:56.370 --> 01:00.740
So we want to add the numbers one by one by ourselves and do it.

17
01:00.870 --> 01:02.740
So you want to do it using loop.

18
01:02.850 --> 01:05.210
So first you do it using pen and paper.

19
01:05.250 --> 01:11.250
First you do it on paper, directly you cannot write the program directly you cannot, unless and until

20
01:11.250 --> 01:13.590
you have already seen it already you know it.

21
01:13.710 --> 01:18.270
Then you can type it but first time when you are solving a problem, this is a basic problem.

22
01:18.270 --> 01:20.680
Do it on paper do some paperwork.

23
01:20.730 --> 01:23.070
So how these numbers can be added.

24
01:23.220 --> 01:27.230
So I have done the paper work here so I'll explain this one first.

25
01:27.270 --> 01:28.150
Number one.

26
01:28.520 --> 01:28.880
OK.

27
01:28.890 --> 01:29.870
One is I.

28
01:30.000 --> 01:31.540
One is added With what initially.

29
01:31.560 --> 01:31.910
Okay.

30
01:31.980 --> 01:33.220
Let it be zero.

31
01:33.270 --> 01:34.300
We got one.

32
01:34.410 --> 01:35.640
The next number is 2.

33
01:36.210 --> 01:38.190
So this in this one we are having two.

34
01:38.190 --> 01:40.440
We got three the next number is three.

35
01:40.440 --> 01:45.360
So in this three in this three we will add three we get the result six then in the sixth we will

36
01:45.420 --> 01:50.490
add four we get 10 and this at 10 we will add five we get 15 so on.

37
01:50.490 --> 01:57.540
So it means we have to go on accumulating this number or adding this number to something so that we

38
01:57.540 --> 01:59.520
are going on getting the sum in the next number.

39
02:00.120 --> 02:04.180
And we have the big the numbers from 1 2 3 4 5 up to the given number 9.

40
02:04.200 --> 02:06.210
We want 9 up to 9 we have 2.

41
02:06.630 --> 02:10.160
So this is looking like a counter that we have seen in the previous video.

42
02:10.200 --> 02:10.800
Yes.

43
02:10.800 --> 02:18.420
So I can take it as i and initially i started from 1 then this I is getting added to something

44
02:18.420 --> 02:19.080
every time.

45
02:19.200 --> 02:23.440
So for that I will take one more thing that is sum and initially zero.

46
02:23.760 --> 02:25.650
So what is this sum.

47
02:26.100 --> 02:30.160
And in that what is I did I make does it.

48
02:30.180 --> 02:35.290
And then when the result is  stored see this two are added

49
02:35.400 --> 02:37.780
And this result is taken again in the next step.

50
02:38.010 --> 02:42.750
So this result should go into sum only sum was initially zero then sum became one then sum

51
02:42.750 --> 02:45.230
became three, sum became six so on.

52
02:45.290 --> 02:46.670
So it is getting added to sum.

53
02:46.680 --> 02:53.240
So I should write like this sum assign some plus I .

54
02:53.490 --> 02:59.000
that's it, so that  statement I got, from this data from the observation we got that statement.

55
02:59.070 --> 03:00.510
Now you are learning right.

56
03:00.660 --> 03:05.870
So the next time when you have similar problems some other thing then you can figure out this one.

57
03:06.000 --> 03:10.050
So you should first put the values on paper then you can observe this one.

58
03:10.050 --> 03:16.260
So now we got the idea that we have to take I, I should be increasing by 1 every time and it should reach

59
03:16.290 --> 03:20.850
up to I N that is 9 and every dime that I should be added to sum.

60
03:21.810 --> 03:24.350
So what are the repeating steps.

61
03:24.360 --> 03:30.030
Take I added and increase I added increase I added increment i added.

62
03:30.150 --> 03:31.630
So these are the steps.

63
03:31.800 --> 03:33.560
So already you have written a flow chart here.

64
03:33.690 --> 03:35.750
Let us study that flow chart.

65
03:35.960 --> 03:37.930
Start take a number then.

66
03:38.280 --> 03:40.790
Initially I is one and sum is zero.

67
03:40.800 --> 03:42.480
This is one and this is zero.

68
03:42.560 --> 03:46.650
Then if I use less than equal to n we have to add till this number right.

69
03:46.980 --> 03:54.270
If it is true then we have to do two things first add then later on increment i, first add then increment

70
03:54.270 --> 03:56.280
see  first is this column.

71
03:56.280 --> 03:59.470
Second this this column may not matter it doesn't matter.

72
03:59.470 --> 04:04.900
whatever the column is but who is executing first this one, addition has done first then I

73
04:04.920 --> 04:11.540
is increasing, additions is done first then increase then again repeat again repeat as long as condition

74
04:11.540 --> 04:16.670
is true if the condition is false we the sum put in some and stop.

75
04:17.190 --> 04:22.560
So this is the procedure now we have a flowchart looking at a flow chart we will write a program.

76
04:22.680 --> 04:29.040
So already you have written a few useful statements I have N and I and sum look at the variables we

77
04:29.040 --> 04:33.500
need and I and some we need three variables.

78
04:33.630 --> 04:35.310
So I have taken three variables.

79
04:35.310 --> 04:42.390
First of all we should read n so already i have finished it and I should start from one end, sum in zero

80
04:42.570 --> 04:46.440
sum I have made it as zero I should start from one.

81
04:46.470 --> 04:51.030
This is one thing then next is condition and I is incresed

82
04:51.180 --> 05:00.700
So these three things together is for loop. Yes I can write a loop for I assign one i is less equal

83
05:00.700 --> 05:06.700
to n I plus plus say this statement is finished.

84
05:06.700 --> 05:12.040
Condition is finished and this is finished now what is remaining inside the loop only this statement

85
05:12.040 --> 05:13.510
is remaining inside the loop.

86
05:13.510 --> 05:19.150
So let us write on that statement inside the loop some assign some plus i

87
05:22.530 --> 05:26.410
than, once it is out of the loop we have to print sum.

88
05:26.670 --> 05:34.650
So i will give a message here sum of first  natural number is sum of n numbers is in short I am

89
05:34.650 --> 05:45.150
writing is I got a  sum in this variable sum, then return 0 OK return 0 and end of main function

90
05:45.800 --> 05:46.580
that's it.

91
05:46.890 --> 05:52.140
So that flowchart is converted into a program now few more thing i want show you instead of using for loop

92
05:52.140 --> 05:58.160
loop if you say no I will use a while loop you can write while loop also but it is better because for

93
05:58.170 --> 06:04.340
loop you can understand that I is starting from 1 and stopping at n you can clearly understand that

94
06:04.570 --> 06:11.280
other wise you can change it to for loop  also I will show how to change it and one more time this  sum assign

95
06:11.290 --> 06:14.600
sum +I,  this is there.

96
06:14.610 --> 06:16.780
So sum is on the right hand side also.

97
06:16.890 --> 06:23.100
So already we have seen compound that is arithmetic operator, assignment operator so we can

98
06:23.100 --> 06:27.900
use that one here so compound assignment operator we can use. sum plus assign i.

99
06:27.960 --> 06:34.560
I already have discussed about this one so you can use this not instead for loop if you want to use while 

100
06:34.560 --> 06:41.480
loop then, one thing I have to do here is I should take i as one here only, means before this I should

101
06:41.500 --> 06:49.120
right then instead of for I will write while in here, then what is the condition as long as i is less than n

102
06:49.120 --> 06:56.310
then what about I plus plus inside the loop I have to do it so inside the for there are three

103
06:56.310 --> 07:04.050
things I will write them here once again I assigned one and i is  less equal to n I plus plus see this

104
07:04.050 --> 07:08.030
portion is gone here and this is as it is.

105
07:08.130 --> 07:11.220
And this plus plus is inside the loop.

106
07:11.320 --> 07:14.050
So this is using while loop right.

107
07:14.380 --> 07:18.760
So the same thing you can do it using while loop also even you can do it using dowhile loop also.

108
07:19.480 --> 07:26.830
So what I have to say here is that you can use any loop you want but for means you should use when you

109
07:26.830 --> 07:32.950
know the number of times of reputation, while when you don't want a number of times of repetition. it is

110
07:32.950 --> 07:33.720
readable.

111
07:34.010 --> 07:38.160
if anybody's reading he can understand that and that's it.

112
07:39.190 --> 07:40.480
So that's all in this video.

113
07:41.080 --> 07:45.880
So there is a coding exercise available level for this one you finish that coding exercise and also

114
07:46.060 --> 07:49.000
a write up program by your self, in encoding exercise.

115
07:49.000 --> 07:50.430
You have to write down this portion.

116
07:51.100 --> 07:53.230
So using for loop you have to find the sum right.

117
07:53.230 --> 07:55.450
You don't have to  the input like this.

118
07:55.510 --> 07:58.970
So if you read the coding exercise description you can understand it.

119
07:59.410 --> 08:03.400
do the coding excersice to say that and also write this complete program by yourself.

120
08:03.930 --> 08:04.440
That's all.
