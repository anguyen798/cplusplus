00:01.140 --> 00:07.260
Now let us look at a program for checking if a number is Armstrong number or not.

00:08.040 --> 00:09.840
So what does it mean by Armstrong?

00:09.870 --> 00:11.250
First we will learn that.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.380
Then we'll see the procedure in that program.

00:13.860 --> 00:15.840
Let us see what is an Armstrong number?

00:15.870 --> 00:18.300
See if I have a number 153.

00:18.330 --> 00:19.720
Take out the digits of a number.

00:19.740 --> 00:20.710
What are the digits?

00:20.730 --> 00:24.300
If we take out, we have already seen that we can get the digits from the last.

00:24.330 --> 00:24.570
Okay.

00:24.570 --> 00:25.230
No problem.

00:25.230 --> 00:27.190
For three, then five.

00:27.210 --> 00:28.080
Then one.

00:28.290 --> 00:30.150
Take the cubes of these digits.

00:30.180 --> 00:30.900
Cubic.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.760
Then are there cubes?

00:32.760 --> 00:36.270
So one cube is one only and five cubes.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.180
125 and three cubes.

00:39.180 --> 00:40.250
27.

00:40.260 --> 00:41.700
So how much this is.

00:41.700 --> 00:45.620
125 140, 52 153.

00:45.630 --> 00:47.670
Again, we got a number 153.

00:48.100 --> 00:54.090
See some of the cubes of the digits of a number is equal to number itself.

00:54.090 --> 01:00.240
So that is Carlos Armstrong, number one, five three digits are taken and the cubes are taken added.

01:00.330 --> 01:04.080
We get 153 some of the cubes of digits of a number.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.900
If they are equal to a number, then it is an Armstrong number.

01:07.520 --> 01:08.760
Now, how to do this?

01:08.880 --> 01:10.290
We need the digits.

01:10.650 --> 01:12.770
Don't we know how to get digit digits?

01:12.780 --> 01:15.300
Yes, we have already seen it in the previous video.

01:15.600 --> 01:18.350
So for 153, also, we can take out the digits.

01:18.360 --> 01:25.980
If you remember this, I have changed it for 153 153 more by ten we get three divided by 1015, then

01:25.980 --> 01:27.750
more by ten we get five.

01:27.780 --> 01:31.890
Divide more by ten one then divide we can get it.

01:32.280 --> 01:36.840
Then what we have to do, we have to find some of the cubes.

01:36.840 --> 01:38.280
Some of the cubes.

01:38.280 --> 01:46.560
So we will have one more variable sum that is initially equal to zero, then zero plus first time three

01:46.560 --> 01:46.980
cubes.

01:46.980 --> 01:48.780
So I'll write down three cubes like this.

01:50.130 --> 01:51.450
This will be three cube.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.930
The next is three cube plus five cubes, right?

01:54.930 --> 02:03.150
So three three cube plus five cube and we get total 152 here I'll write like that then 152 plus one

02:03.150 --> 02:11.610
cube is 153 and a number became zero stop so we can take the sum and here I can write down the statement.

02:11.610 --> 02:13.920
Sum, assign, sum plus.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.330
The three and five.

02:17.330 --> 02:20.380
And one way we are getting it here are.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.100
So this is our cube.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.090
Our cube.

02:23.510 --> 02:28.490
So, yes, in the same procedure where we were displaying the digits, now we will add the cubes of

02:28.490 --> 02:32.270
those digits and some variable and we get the number.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.520
Now check the number that you got.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.250
153 is the same as the original number.

02:37.250 --> 02:40.250
Where is the original number and what it has became?

02:40.250 --> 02:41.930
Oh, this has become zero.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.670
So this is the problem in this one.

02:44.730 --> 02:47.420
The original number, you are dividing it by ten.

02:47.430 --> 02:49.080
So it is becoming zero finally.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.700
So you should preserve that number.

02:50.700 --> 02:57.960
So let us take some more variable m inside that we will keep this value 153 Then check with this m right.

02:57.990 --> 03:01.410
153 that sum is 153 Is it same as this?

03:01.410 --> 03:03.370
M Yes, at the same.

03:03.570 --> 03:05.670
So it's an Armstrong number.

03:05.670 --> 03:07.020
So we have seen the procedure.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.610
Now let us look at the flow chart.

03:08.610 --> 03:09.720
So it is the flow chart.

03:09.720 --> 03:15.900
Take a number, some is initialized with zero and just said that our number is becoming zero, so we

03:15.900 --> 03:17.550
should preserve it in some other variable.

03:17.550 --> 03:23.070
So in I have taken this is the loop already you are familiar with, right in the previous video we have

03:23.070 --> 03:28.800
discussed now I was printing after this so I don't have to print, I'm writing some assign some plus

03:28.800 --> 03:29.490
R cube.

03:29.490 --> 03:33.480
So I have to take the cube of a digit and add it.

03:33.480 --> 03:39.360
To sum that step I have to add then once the loop ends, see, I have to show it separately because

03:39.360 --> 03:40.320
there's is a loop, right?

03:40.350 --> 03:47.460
If it is false, it comes here and check if man same are same if same same strong otherwise not and

03:47.460 --> 03:48.900
strong and stop.

03:48.900 --> 03:54.660
So I have to check the number whether some is equal to that m original number.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.820
So same thing I will write down here.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.220
See we need some.

03:59.220 --> 04:02.520
Also we need one more variable m also.

04:02.520 --> 04:08.400
So after taking a variable I will make m assign nn value will keep it here.

04:08.430 --> 04:14.190
The procedure is same already we have written this logic while number is greater than zero and we were

04:14.190 --> 04:22.140
finding out first more that is last digit and the more the ten then n was getting divided by ten.

04:22.140 --> 04:31.050
Now one more extra work we have to do that is some assign some plus r cubed, so r into r into r three

04:31.050 --> 04:31.620
times.

04:32.040 --> 04:33.120
This is the procedure.

04:34.470 --> 04:35.340
This is Luke.

04:35.430 --> 04:36.390
This is Luke.

04:36.660 --> 04:38.100
Steps repeated.

04:38.130 --> 04:42.840
Then once we come out of the loop, check if M is equal to someone.

04:42.870 --> 04:49.650
So outside the loop, check here if sum is equal to M.

04:49.980 --> 04:53.730
If so, see out as Armstrong.

04:55.260 --> 04:55.620
Right.

04:57.350 --> 04:59.990
Armstrong say it's Armstrong.

05:00.440 --> 05:06.840
Otherwise, else she'll say Not Armstrong.

05:06.860 --> 05:07.820
So that's all.

05:07.820 --> 05:09.890
At last we have to say return zero.

05:10.670 --> 05:12.650
So outside the loop here.

05:12.800 --> 05:17.600
So this is a program for finding numbers, Armstrong, or not?

05:17.900 --> 05:18.890
Simple logic.

05:19.070 --> 05:22.760
In the previous program, we have just added one statement.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.760
That is, we are finding the sum of the cubes.

05:25.790 --> 05:26.510
That's all.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.850
So write this program by yourself.

05:29.860 --> 05:34.630
There is a coding exercise for this one, so complete that and also write on the program by yourself

05:34.630 --> 05:35.500
in coding exercise.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.820
Just you have to write on this part.

05:36.820 --> 05:38.760
You don't have to take input, right?

05:38.770 --> 05:43.090
Since your you read the description, you'll find out only the logic you have to write on.

05:44.230 --> 05:49.300
Now, in the next video, again, the topic is based on the same logic.

05:50.070 --> 05:50.460
Okay.

05:50.460 --> 05:51.570
So I'll keep it as it is.

05:51.570 --> 05:52.620
This I will not change.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.240
The number will also be same.

05:54.450 --> 05:56.940
Now let us look at the next program.
