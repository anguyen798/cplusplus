00:00.720 --> 00:07.050
Let us write a program for displaying multiplication table for a given number.

1
00:07.080 --> 00:16.290
This problem uses loop. where loop is used, where ever you have repeating statements so you are first

2
00:16.290 --> 00:22.680
task or challenge for a student will be to identify whether the procedure is having repeating statements

3
00:22.680 --> 00:23.540
or not.

4
00:23.550 --> 00:25.640
If so then you can use a loop.

5
00:25.740 --> 00:27.690
So for that you should understand the procedure.

6
00:27.690 --> 00:33.480
First of all so let us learn how to understand the procedure and how to take a loop and solve a problem.

7
00:33.480 --> 00:35.250
So here is a very basic problem.

8
00:35.250 --> 00:37.950
Let us see a multiplication tables.

9
00:37.950 --> 00:41.910
Already I have an example of multiplication table, this is how it looks like.

10
00:41.910 --> 00:44.210
For example number six.

11
00:44.330 --> 00:46.800
we write it like this:  six ones is six.

12
00:46.830 --> 00:50.480
six two times is 12.

13
00:50.570 --> 00:51.440
Six three is 18

14
00:51.510 --> 00:52.830
so on

15
00:53.160 --> 00:56.230
So we write like this. same thing,

16
00:56.230 --> 00:59.700
We want our program to print now.

17
00:59.710 --> 01:05.920
If you observe every time a number six is multiplied by something and we get the result and we displayed

18
01:06.200 --> 01:09.630
then they get multiplied by some number and display it multiplied by some number and

19
01:09.640 --> 01:10.380
display in this way

20
01:10.820 --> 01:13.530
So this is not just a one time multiplication.

21
01:13.600 --> 01:17.520
We are going on multiplying how many times ten times you are multiplying.

22
01:17.770 --> 01:18.630
Yes.

23
01:18.850 --> 01:22.370
Then in this what other things we should know first of all we should know.

24
01:22.390 --> 01:22.870
a number

25
01:22.990 --> 01:24.410
This is a number right.

26
01:24.430 --> 01:26.440
So here i will write a number.

27
01:26.470 --> 01:30.290
Then it should be multiplied by 1 then 2 then 3 and 4.

28
01:30.310 --> 01:32.380
This is looking like a cpunter.

29
01:32.440 --> 01:32.760
Yes.

30
01:32.770 --> 01:35.700
We saw in the previous video we have used

31
01:35.770 --> 01:36.750
i there.

32
01:36.760 --> 01:41.130
I was becoming one then two then three four then so on, right.

33
01:41.170 --> 01:42.800
So that's what is a counter.

34
01:42.820 --> 01:44.140
So let us use that same.

35
01:44.160 --> 01:45.850
I hear i

36
01:46.750 --> 01:49.030
Then how we are getting this result.

37
01:49.120 --> 01:50.980
Six then twelve then 18

38
01:51.190 --> 01:54.100
This is obtained by multiplying these two.

39
01:54.100 --> 02:00.580
So this is nothing but I into n or n into i, whatever you say those two are multiplied.

40
02:00.790 --> 02:01.750
That's it.

41
02:01.810 --> 02:08.980
So it means I should take N and I and I should multiply and get it and every step I should be increased

42
02:09.070 --> 02:11.750
number remains same, i should be increased.

43
02:11.830 --> 02:15.030
So this is how I should frame a procedure for this.

44
02:15.050 --> 02:21.240
So the procedure is take i from 1 onwards and go on multiply it by 6 and getting the answer.

45
02:22.030 --> 02:27.540
So for how to do that I have drawn a flowchart already I have an example of flowchart here.

46
02:27.620 --> 02:29.530
Let us look at the flow chart.

47
02:29.770 --> 02:31.200
Start enter a number.

48
02:31.240 --> 02:32.470
We should know a number right.

49
02:32.500 --> 02:33.410
We should know a number.

50
02:33.700 --> 02:35.230
Then we should have i.

51
02:35.230 --> 02:36.420
Initially it should be 1.

52
02:36.550 --> 02:37.730
I should be made as 1.

53
02:37.750 --> 02:40.070
So number is a given and I is also 1.

54
02:40.280 --> 02:44.210
Then how many times we have to display 10, 1-10  only.

55
02:44.220 --> 02:45.180
That is sufficient.

56
02:45.310 --> 02:47.510
So I should reach ten.

57
02:47.530 --> 02:48.350
Then it should stop.

58
02:48.390 --> 02:50.500
But it becomes eleven then you should stop.

59
02:50.500 --> 02:52.060
So I is less than equal to 10.

60
02:52.270 --> 02:52.950
Yes.

61
02:53.110 --> 02:54.390
Then what I have to do.

62
02:54.430 --> 02:58.410
I'm just printing I into n, this portion I am printing, this portion.

63
02:58.420 --> 03:05.230
print this one then increase the value of i, I plus plus so I assign  I plus one, increase the value

64
03:05.590 --> 03:07.000
then again continue.

65
03:07.020 --> 03:08.450
Again check the condition.

66
03:08.620 --> 03:10.030
It's less than 10 right.

67
03:10.180 --> 03:11.400
Then again multiply.

68
03:11.430 --> 03:14.350
Get the result, then,  I assign a plus one.

69
03:14.350 --> 03:16.120
So i becomes three then check.

70
03:16.120 --> 03:16.980
It's less than 10.

71
03:17.050 --> 03:17.620
Yes.

72
03:17.620 --> 03:21.270
Then multiply it then i becomes four.

73
03:21.320 --> 03:24.160
It's less than 10 multiplied I become 5.

74
03:24.460 --> 03:26.330
So this is how it will be repeating.

75
03:26.440 --> 03:28.870
And when I is not less than equal to 10.

76
03:28.870 --> 03:30.340
That is false it will stop.

77
03:31.200 --> 03:35.020
So I have already drawn a flowchart based on this working.

78
03:35.260 --> 03:37.350
Now let us convert this into a simple program.

79
03:37.360 --> 03:40.980
So we will see the flow chart and convert it. in our program,

80
03:40.990 --> 03:43.840
We need to take input that is n right.

81
03:43.840 --> 03:46.470
So here I will start from int main,

82
03:46.510 --> 03:49.000
I will not write #include everything.

83
03:49.150 --> 03:51.320
Those libraries you know already.

84
03:51.370 --> 03:54.550
Already we have discussed that. then here

85
03:54.640 --> 03:57.280
I need variables n and I.

86
03:57.430 --> 04:04.590
If you observe this n and I, only two things are used so yes I have taken that now I should read n

87
04:04.610 --> 04:13.030
so for reading n we give a message cout enter n or enter a number whatever

88
04:13.030 --> 04:20.790
you want you can give a suitable message and you can read a number, then i should start from one every

89
04:20.790 --> 04:25.070
time  condition is check it should be less than equal to 10 and also we have to increase i.

90
04:25.330 --> 04:31.550
So if you remember in the previous video I have shown you for loop which is used for counter control.

91
04:31.900 --> 04:32.650
Yes.

92
04:32.650 --> 04:36.140
Here we are using a counter so for counter control.

93
04:36.150 --> 04:37.190
For loop is better.

94
04:37.540 --> 04:39.150
Yes we can use for loop

95
04:39.160 --> 04:49.930
So let us write a for loop for I start from 1 onwards, I is less than equal to 10 and I plus plus right.

96
04:50.080 --> 04:53.290
See first one second one third one.

97
04:53.320 --> 05:00.020
First one second one and third one we have group all those three statements that are related to i.

98
05:00.300 --> 05:05.490
In a one place that is the benefit of for loop now inside this what is happening.

99
05:05.530 --> 05:07.250
1 2 and 3 are over.

100
05:07.630 --> 05:08.560
What is happening.

101
05:08.560 --> 05:09.630
Just we have to print.

102
05:09.670 --> 05:11.120
So I have to print it here.

103
05:11.140 --> 05:12.000
That's all.

104
05:12.010 --> 05:14.460
So say cout.

105
05:15.010 --> 05:20.650
Let us print it is How it is appeared here as it is how to display that.

106
05:21.220 --> 05:23.290
So for that First of i should display no.

107
05:23.730 --> 05:25.110
Number it is a variable.

108
05:25.400 --> 05:25.860
Okay.

109
05:25.900 --> 05:33.550
And then this cross marks this  capital X  I can take it looks like cross marks.

110
05:33.670 --> 05:40.660
Okay I should print X but X is a letter I have to bring so give again in such an operation and give

111
05:40.660 --> 05:45.610
some space and write X and again get some space so that after end we get some space.

112
05:45.610 --> 05:48.310
Then again after this also we get some space.

113
05:48.310 --> 05:51.600
Then this one is one two three, Oh this is I.

114
05:51.640 --> 05:58.780
Yes I can use counter I then we need equal symbol so again that is a string or a character.

115
05:58.860 --> 06:03.750
So give space and equal to sign and again go.

116
06:03.840 --> 06:04.930
Then after that.

117
06:04.930 --> 06:07.480
This i into n this is display so there is no space.

118
06:07.480 --> 06:08.620
I'll just remove this.

119
06:08.670 --> 06:09.100
Okay.

120
06:09.150 --> 06:10.890
We know it well,  just i will remove it.

121
06:11.550 --> 06:15.850
So here again insertion operation I into n.

122
06:15.960 --> 06:18.520
And it will be displaying this then.

123
06:19.200 --> 06:23.230
After finishing first line it should go to the next line for the next value.

124
06:23.230 --> 06:23.960
Next row.

125
06:23.980 --> 06:25.680
So I should give e5ndl also.

126
06:25.680 --> 06:30.730
So here I will continue or else I can write here also cout endl.

127
06:31.380 --> 06:35.950
So even all these I can write them in different Cout one below another also.

128
06:35.940 --> 06:37.590
Also I get the same result.

129
06:37.890 --> 06:42.550
So once unless and until I say endl, it will not appear in the next line.

130
06:43.050 --> 06:46.350
So that's it this is for loop close this for loop.

131
06:46.410 --> 06:52.590
Then as we have said int so we have to see a return zero end of the main function.

132
06:53.370 --> 06:58.070
So this is the program for displaying multiplication table for a given number.

133
06:58.440 --> 07:04.020
So there is a demo available you can watch that demo and you have to practice this program on your own machine.

134
07:04.020 --> 07:07.110
No one more important thing in the coming topics.

135
07:07.110 --> 07:12.780
I'll be showing few more programs and most of the programs are depend on the counter like

136
07:12.780 --> 07:17.010
this so I may be using the counter and show you other programs also.

137
07:17.640 --> 07:19.590
OK so that's all in this video.
