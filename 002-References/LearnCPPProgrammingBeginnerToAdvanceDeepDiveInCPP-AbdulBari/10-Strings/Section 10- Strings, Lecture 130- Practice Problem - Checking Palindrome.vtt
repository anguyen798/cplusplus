00:00.480 --> 00:06.720
Our next challenge is to check whether a given string is a palindrome or not.

00:07.560 --> 00:08.930
So first of all, I'll explain.

00:08.970 --> 00:10.470
What does it mean by palindrome?

00:11.190 --> 00:13.770
So here a string is, madam.

00:14.400 --> 00:20.970
So if I reverse this, madam, like here, I will write down madam.

00:21.210 --> 00:23.130
Now, first, I will write last letter.

00:23.530 --> 00:28.500
Write this one, then this one A, then D, then a m.

00:28.740 --> 00:30.150
So it's the same word.

00:30.570 --> 00:33.300
So reversing a word is giving a same word.

00:33.300 --> 00:36.000
So then this word is called as palindrome.

00:36.330 --> 00:36.960
It's the same thing.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.670
So reverse of a word is same as original word.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.050
Then it is a palindrome word.

00:43.650 --> 00:45.000
There are many palindrome words.

00:45.030 --> 00:46.260
I'll write a few more.

00:47.250 --> 00:50.140
Little is a palindrome.

00:50.160 --> 00:53.640
This is name of some product or brand malayalam.

00:54.660 --> 00:55.950
Malayalam.

00:56.130 --> 00:58.230
This is a name of one language.

00:58.230 --> 00:59.180
Indian language.

00:59.190 --> 00:59.980
If you reverse.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.020
It's the same thing.

01:01.690 --> 01:03.060
Name of a person.

01:04.090 --> 01:04.870
Newton.

01:05.860 --> 01:06.850
Then reverse it.

01:06.880 --> 01:07.840
It's the same thing.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.930
So such words are called us palindrome.

01:10.950 --> 01:14.970
So we have to find all this, given the string is a palindrome or not.

01:15.660 --> 01:17.910
So for that, first of all, we should reverse it.

01:18.840 --> 01:22.050
So I will explain you the procedure, how it can be done.

01:22.060 --> 01:24.420
Then you have to write down the program by yourself.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.580
So the first thing, first step, this is a given string.

01:28.590 --> 01:33.230
Then we need one empty string in which we will reverse copy this string.

01:33.240 --> 01:43.800
So we should copy this letter first into this empty string, then a, then D, then a, then we have

01:43.800 --> 01:48.570
to reverse copy it and then also include null character at the end.

01:49.170 --> 01:55.650
So this is how from by scanning in this direction, you can copy these letters by scanning this array

01:55.650 --> 01:57.510
in this direction from left to right.

01:57.780 --> 01:59.430
So this is string is reversed.

01:59.430 --> 02:00.750
So it is reverse copied.

02:01.260 --> 02:06.570
Now you have to find out whether these two strings are same so you can compare two strings.

02:06.990 --> 02:11.160
So there are built in functions for comparing two strings.

02:11.220 --> 02:13.980
Otherwise you can compare letter by letter.

02:13.980 --> 02:21.300
And if any letter is found different from corresponding letter, you can just stop and say it's not

02:21.300 --> 02:22.110
a palindrome.

02:22.320 --> 02:27.660
Or if you have reached the end of the string for both main string and the reverse string, you have

02:27.660 --> 02:29.340
reached the null character for both.

02:29.370 --> 02:31.620
Then you can say they are palindromes.

02:33.550 --> 02:38.830
So I repeat quickly, first you have to copy this in reverse here and then compare if they are same

02:38.830 --> 02:39.490
or not.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.250
Now how to reverse copy.

02:41.260 --> 02:44.050
So first of all, you should know what is the length of the string.

02:44.050 --> 02:48.970
So for finding the length you have built in functions or you can find out the length by yourself also.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.990
So find out the length and the length of the string will be five.

02:53.020 --> 02:56.500
So you have to start copying the letters from index four onwards.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.980
Write whatever the length is, minus one onwards, up to zero.

03:00.160 --> 03:03.970
And here you can scan by taking a from left to right.

03:03.970 --> 03:08.860
And once you have reached the end here last letter, then also add slash zero.

03:09.310 --> 03:12.820
So find the length and copy the letters one by one.

03:12.820 --> 03:20.080
And this a string you can simply call compare function by passing a reverse of a string and it will

03:20.080 --> 03:22.540
return zero if they are equal.

03:23.590 --> 03:27.130
So that's all I have given enough idea for solving this problem.

03:27.130 --> 03:29.980
So you try to write the programme by yourself.

03:30.070 --> 03:34.360
So pause the video here and solve the programme by yourself.

03:34.720 --> 03:39.220
If you are unable to solve or if you want help, then you can continue watching this video.

03:39.430 --> 03:43.210
Now I will show you the programme for checking a string is a palindrome or not.

03:43.690 --> 03:47.310
Already I have taken a string containing a palindrome that is Madam.

03:47.680 --> 03:53.740
Now, for storing the reverse of it, I should declare a variable V I'll keep it empty.

03:55.300 --> 04:00.680
Now I should make sure that the capacity of this RV should be same as this star.

04:00.700 --> 04:04.660
So for that, I should change its size by calling this size.

04:04.660 --> 04:07.480
So first of all, I will find out what is the length of this one.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.970
So I will say end length.

04:09.970 --> 04:12.670
Assign struct length.

04:13.510 --> 04:13.810
Here.

04:13.810 --> 04:14.950
I'm getting a warning.

04:15.100 --> 04:22.870
So the reason is actually this lent function returns long end survival type cost it as integer and ticket.

04:24.920 --> 04:30.860
Now for RTV, I should say resize and make sure that the size is equal to land.

04:30.860 --> 04:32.840
That is same as the length of the str.

04:36.840 --> 04:43.620
Now I have to scan through this string that is reverse string for copying the content from STR and from

04:43.650 --> 04:44.070
STR.

04:44.070 --> 04:45.930
I'll be copying from right hand side.

04:46.380 --> 04:52.170
So for scanning through I will take a follow an integer I assign zero.

04:52.200 --> 05:00.810
This is for V and also I need J that is J starts from length minus one and I should continue scanning

05:00.810 --> 05:03.810
of reverse as long as I is less than length.

05:03.810 --> 05:11.280
So I less than Len and I should increment and j should be decrement at.

05:12.320 --> 05:15.110
Not while doing so in reverse of I.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.740
I should copy the characters from str of J.

05:20.600 --> 05:26.180
Now this look will reverse copy all the contents of STR to arrive.

05:26.870 --> 05:34.400
Then at the end I should take a review of length equal to null character.

05:34.430 --> 05:35.900
That's String Terminator.

05:36.350 --> 05:42.320
Now before checking palindrome or not, I will see out V and see whether it has reversed or not.

05:45.630 --> 05:51.900
Yes, it has reversed a string, so I got the same as reverse of str.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.260
Now.

05:54.470 --> 06:01.430
As for displaying, I will compare two strains that is RTV is same as STR or not.

06:01.460 --> 06:08.090
So here I will say str dot compare with RB if you remember compare function.

06:08.090 --> 06:09.950
I have explained them in one of the video.

06:11.060 --> 06:13.550
It will return zero if they are equal.

06:13.580 --> 06:17.150
If it is returning zero, then I will say palindrome.

06:19.320 --> 06:20.490
Right then.

06:20.490 --> 06:24.510
And I'll also else I will say not a palindrome.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.450
Not a palindrome.

06:30.150 --> 06:31.000
And enter.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.060
Let us run and see.

06:35.730 --> 06:36.360
Yes.

06:36.360 --> 06:37.830
It is showing palindrome.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.230
Madam is a palindrome.

06:41.070 --> 06:41.820
That's all.

06:42.150 --> 06:43.410
Just, like, perfect.

06:43.440 --> 06:44.910
Let me try a few more.

06:45.870 --> 06:46.620
What?

06:49.640 --> 06:50.720
Malayalam.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.480
Yes.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.790
It's a palindrome holiday.

06:58.210 --> 07:01.720
It's not a palindrome, so it's working perfectly.

07:01.870 --> 07:03.200
I'll give you one more challenge.

07:03.220 --> 07:08.550
I will take one capital letter and the rest of them small letters.

07:08.560 --> 07:10.030
Let us see what it will say.

07:11.730 --> 07:12.940
Not a palindrome.

07:12.960 --> 07:16.110
Actually, it's a palindrome, but the first letter is capital.

07:16.140 --> 07:21.030
So when you reverse, it will become a a capital M.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.660
So that's why these two are not same.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.200
Now, how to handle this situation?

07:26.210 --> 07:27.430
You take care of it.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.090
So there's a new challenge for you.

07:30.220 --> 07:33.190
Let's all in this video practice this program.
