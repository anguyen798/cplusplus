WEBVTT

00:00.940 --> 00:01.450
Yeah.

00:01.450 --> 00:06.300
In this video I will show you various member functions of a string class.

00:06.310 --> 00:10.360
I have a few more functions listed here, so I'll explain you one by one.

00:10.480 --> 00:13.300
And also I will give the demonstration simultaneously.

00:14.410 --> 00:16.270
See a function append.

00:16.720 --> 00:20.560
This will add a new content to a string.

00:21.690 --> 00:22.020
Right.

00:22.020 --> 00:24.630
Suppose you already have a string.

00:25.300 --> 00:27.450
I'm using the same word.

00:27.450 --> 00:27.840
That is.

00:27.840 --> 00:28.490
Hello.

00:29.410 --> 00:29.940
Right.

00:30.400 --> 00:34.510
Then after this, if you say X dot append.

00:36.780 --> 00:42.510
And if I write war, then it becomes Hello world.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.650
So this will be added at the end.

00:45.650 --> 00:48.020
So amendments it will be added at the end.

00:48.050 --> 00:52.340
So as already told you that it will be stored in an area.

00:55.370 --> 00:55.610
Right.

00:55.730 --> 00:57.140
Help is already there.

00:57.680 --> 00:58.290
Right.

00:58.310 --> 01:00.170
Then it was null character.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.550
Now this will be removed.

01:01.730 --> 01:04.580
And here it will store world.

01:05.410 --> 01:07.410
And then add Noel Gallagher.

01:07.840 --> 01:12.160
Now, whether it will increase the capacity or not is a different thing.

01:12.370 --> 01:18.070
See, already we have seen that though we have a certain size as five, the capacity was more than this.

01:18.310 --> 01:21.620
So in our example, it was showing some size 22.

01:21.650 --> 01:22.260
Right.

01:22.270 --> 01:24.220
So it means more spaces are there.

01:24.310 --> 01:30.490
So now this word will be stored in that vacant spaces that are free spaces.

01:30.490 --> 01:31.180
After this.

01:31.180 --> 01:31.690
Hello.

01:32.350 --> 01:35.290
And if it require, it may increase the size.

01:35.290 --> 01:37.450
So actually it will not increase the same size.

01:37.450 --> 01:41.840
It will create a bigger size array and it will store it there.

01:41.860 --> 01:42.760
So what happens?

01:42.760 --> 01:49.210
We can see how that function, this open function will handle it, how it is defined inside the compiler.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.110
We can see that.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.960
So just we can run it and observe how it is working.

01:53.650 --> 02:02.080
So right now this is as but after appending in the same as this is also stored well or else a new array

02:02.080 --> 02:04.250
is created where everything is done here.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.650
Both things are possible.

02:06.430 --> 02:09.150
All right, so let us test this function.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.080
I will write down hello.

02:11.080 --> 02:11.410
And then.

02:11.440 --> 02:15.610
Well, then also I will try to take a bigger string and see what happens.

02:15.940 --> 02:21.220
So already I have written a program here which is having a string containing hello.

02:21.250 --> 02:25.780
Then here I will say str dot append.

02:29.340 --> 02:31.230
Then I will write word.

02:33.230 --> 02:35.270
Then afterwards, I'm displaying a string.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.190
Let us see what happens.

02:39.200 --> 02:39.650
Yeah.

02:39.650 --> 02:41.300
It has became Hello World.

02:42.140 --> 02:46.060
And if you want a space after this hello, then you can give a space here.

02:46.070 --> 02:47.370
Space world.

02:47.390 --> 02:49.910
Then it will become Hello Space, then world.

02:51.410 --> 02:53.070
Now one more thing I will do.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.680
Let us check the capacity.

02:54.950 --> 02:58.490
See out star capacity.

02:59.420 --> 02:59.990
Right.

03:00.950 --> 03:09.050
And here and before adding this content, then also after adding this content, let us see the capacity.

03:09.050 --> 03:09.890
What happens?

03:12.030 --> 03:15.950
See the capacity was 22 and after opening also the capacity is 22.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.870
Only then helloworld is the new string.

03:21.030 --> 03:22.590
Moral change the string.

03:23.400 --> 03:24.840
I will write it as.

03:25.710 --> 03:28.620
How are you all?

03:29.640 --> 03:31.650
Hope all are fine.

03:32.220 --> 03:36.020
I guess this is longer than size 22, right?

03:36.030 --> 03:38.070
This is the size 22, maybe longer than that.

03:38.070 --> 03:41.040
Or else I'll type a few more things just randomly.

03:41.790 --> 03:43.320
Now let us see what happens.

03:46.280 --> 03:51.590
See capacity before this attending was 22.

03:51.650 --> 03:56.390
Then when I have appended something, the capacity has increased, so it has automatically increased

03:56.390 --> 03:57.530
the size of an array.

03:58.370 --> 04:03.830
Right now here, after the capacity, I will also display length.

04:03.860 --> 04:06.800
Let us see what is the length and what is the capacity?

04:07.610 --> 04:09.880
Length will be definitely less than the capacity.

04:09.890 --> 04:15.590
So here by taking length, I know how many characters are there in a string.

04:15.590 --> 04:17.180
So first I am displaying capacity.

04:17.200 --> 04:20.030
Next time displaying length, let us run it.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.190
Yes.

04:23.790 --> 04:27.180
See, capacity is 79 and land is 74.

04:28.110 --> 04:28.470
Right?

04:28.470 --> 04:31.610
So total 74 characters I have typed here.

04:31.620 --> 04:32.010
Right.

04:32.010 --> 04:36.360
Including the helo and the capacity it has.

04:37.590 --> 04:40.410
The capacity it has taken us 79.

04:41.310 --> 04:43.980
So this is about append function.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.920
Let us continue with next function.

04:47.310 --> 04:49.030
So we have finished this one.

04:49.050 --> 04:49.860
Now let us see.

04:49.860 --> 04:55.980
Insert this function will insert a given a string at a given index.

04:56.490 --> 04:58.680
Suppose I have a string.

05:01.910 --> 05:04.220
SDR and the string is.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.060
Hello.

05:06.990 --> 05:07.560
Right.

05:07.600 --> 05:11.460
Then if I say a star dot insert.

05:13.670 --> 05:16.190
Now this is index zero.

05:16.190 --> 05:19.490
Index one, two, three and four.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.190
Now, I want to insert something.

05:22.190 --> 05:25.430
Let us say k k at index three onwards.

05:25.430 --> 05:26.790
So from index three onwards.

05:26.810 --> 05:33.980
So if I say three and some letters like k k, I'm inserting this a string at this place.

05:33.980 --> 05:43.310
So the new string will be it becomes h e l so this is 012, then it will be k k, then this l zero will

05:43.310 --> 05:44.630
be shifted on this side.

05:45.380 --> 05:51.260
So I can insert a string at this place, so you can insert at any location.

05:51.260 --> 05:54.500
So you have to mention the index at which you want to insert.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.720
There is one more version of insert function.

05:56.720 --> 06:01.850
I'll show that insert right now here.

06:02.450 --> 06:02.960
Index.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.280
I'm giving three only.

06:04.460 --> 06:07.210
Then the word is apple.

06:07.220 --> 06:08.690
The string is apple here.

06:08.780 --> 06:12.940
And from this I don't want all these five letters from this word.

06:12.950 --> 06:15.980
I just want two letters so I can mention two.

06:16.190 --> 06:20.780
So it will take only two letters, first two letters of this string and insert them in this.

06:20.780 --> 06:21.360
Hello.

06:21.380 --> 06:25.690
So if I am inserting it in hello, then this will become edge.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.160
That is index zero.

06:27.170 --> 06:29.510
Index one, index two.

06:30.390 --> 06:40.710
Then afterwards a p just it will take ap then remaining alphabets of hello so it will be apl0.

06:41.190 --> 06:46.440
So you can take selected number of alphabets from this one from the beginning.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.160
Right?

06:47.190 --> 06:51.420
If you don't mention this, then it will insert this entire string at this place.

06:52.860 --> 06:54.990
So let us look at the demonstration of this one.

06:55.860 --> 06:57.090
Now I have a string.

06:57.090 --> 06:57.390
Hello.

06:57.390 --> 06:58.140
Here, then.

06:58.140 --> 07:02.580
Here I will say dot insert.

07:03.420 --> 07:09.360
At Index three and I want to insert kick in so that same string I'm writing here.

07:13.080 --> 07:17.090
So you can see that this is X Index zero, right?

07:17.100 --> 07:20.310
Then this is one and this is two.

07:20.310 --> 07:23.370
And from third index is inserted.

07:23.970 --> 07:25.530
So that's all you can insert.

07:26.130 --> 07:28.800
Now, I will write something meaningful here.

07:32.790 --> 07:36.420
How, you know, art is missing here.

07:36.420 --> 07:40.530
So I want to insert R with spaces on either side.

07:40.530 --> 07:42.000
And what should be the index?

07:42.030 --> 07:47.670
Zero one, zero one, two then three at space three.

07:48.030 --> 07:48.540
Right.

07:48.540 --> 07:49.590
So index three.

07:49.590 --> 07:51.060
So, yes, this is perfect.

07:51.060 --> 07:52.410
So let us run it.

07:55.320 --> 07:55.770
Yes.

07:55.770 --> 08:00.530
It has became how are you know, let us try to take a new word.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.450
I will change it to area.

08:02.460 --> 08:03.480
What is area?

08:03.480 --> 08:05.550
And I don't want all three letters.

08:05.550 --> 08:06.450
All four letters.

08:06.450 --> 08:08.310
Just say one, three letters from this one.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.050
So let us see what happens.

08:14.890 --> 08:18.480
So it has taken three litres that is space and A and R.

08:18.490 --> 08:21.080
So actually I should mention four letters total here.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.750
There are five letters here.

08:22.750 --> 08:24.760
So I should mention it as four.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.080
Yes.

08:26.470 --> 08:28.660
So it will take only a R.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.630
So this is about insert function.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.100
So there are a few more operations.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.080
I will show them in next video.
