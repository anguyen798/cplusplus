00:00.420 --> 00:05.670
Our next challenge is to find the username from an email address.

00:05.790 --> 00:07.380
I will explain the problem.

00:07.860 --> 00:15.120
Email address is given here and in this email address there is a symbol hydrate and also dot symbol

00:15.120 --> 00:18.420
is there for the extension or there may be more than 1.5.

00:18.430 --> 00:21.540
Also depends on the website name that is used here.

00:22.260 --> 00:25.620
So whatever is there before activate is a username.

00:26.780 --> 00:30.960
So the task is to find out the user name from email address.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.360
So how to solve this?

00:32.390 --> 00:36.800
To solve this, we have to find out the index of the in this string.

00:37.130 --> 00:41.000
So index of at the rate that is at index seven.

00:41.870 --> 00:44.480
So is there any function available to find out?

00:44.480 --> 00:52.160
The index of it is find function is the or find first off is also there anyway.

00:52.160 --> 00:54.980
This will be only one time at the rate will be only one time.

00:54.980 --> 00:58.160
So find is sufficient to find out the index of this one.

00:59.060 --> 01:06.650
Then we want the entire string from the starting index of zero up to seven.

01:06.740 --> 01:09.290
So is there any function to find out this one?

01:09.560 --> 01:13.310
Yes, there is a function that is sub SDR.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.820
This will find out a substring from any starting index.

01:16.820 --> 01:19.310
We can mention the number of characters that we want.

01:19.400 --> 01:23.660
So we can use the find for finding the index of at the rate.

01:23.690 --> 01:27.950
Then we can use sub SDR for finding the substring from here.

01:28.250 --> 01:30.380
So that does a simple task.

01:30.410 --> 01:33.150
You can write the programme by yourself.

01:33.170 --> 01:36.050
You can post the video and write the program by yourself.

01:36.080 --> 01:40.060
If you can't write or if you want help, you can continue watching the video.

01:40.070 --> 01:44.540
And at the end of the video, I'll discuss more about this email address.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.300
Let us look at the program.

01:46.310 --> 01:49.820
Already I have taken the email address in a string called email.

01:50.690 --> 01:54.090
Now I have to take out only the username from this one for that.

01:54.110 --> 01:57.050
First find out the index of rate.

01:57.380 --> 01:58.520
So int.

02:00.130 --> 02:02.590
I will find out the index of heart rate.

02:02.590 --> 02:06.670
So email dot line and single code.

02:06.670 --> 02:08.830
So as well as I can use the codes.

02:08.830 --> 02:13.510
So find functions are available for both overloaded functions are there.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.130
So I am using find.

02:15.580 --> 02:15.880
Yeah.

02:15.880 --> 02:21.940
It is giving some warning here because this will give the index that is long and so I will typecast

02:21.940 --> 02:22.990
it as integer.

02:23.900 --> 02:24.440
Okay.

02:24.860 --> 02:27.050
Then I will create another string.

02:27.140 --> 02:28.820
That is you name.

02:29.060 --> 02:32.810
And here I will say import service.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.510
Starting index is zero.

02:35.510 --> 02:39.290
And how many letters I want c whatever the index is.

02:39.290 --> 02:44.450
Suppose this index is 01234567 index is seven.

02:44.450 --> 02:46.820
And if we count the number of letters before this one.

02:46.820 --> 02:49.340
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

02:49.340 --> 02:51.260
So there are seven letters.

02:51.260 --> 02:54.260
So whatever the index, I am getting that many letters I want.

02:54.260 --> 02:58.550
So just mention that after this quote.

03:01.460 --> 03:03.830
User name is.

03:05.450 --> 03:06.350
You name.

03:07.280 --> 03:08.750
Now let us run this.

03:11.470 --> 03:12.560
Yes, John.

03:12.580 --> 03:13.660
One, two, three.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.850
Analysts, not even so.

03:16.540 --> 03:18.730
Next message is coming in the same line.

03:19.120 --> 03:19.660
Now it is.

03:20.110 --> 03:21.820
Username is John.

03:22.180 --> 03:23.680
One, two, three.

03:24.810 --> 03:25.500
That's it.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.780
So this was a simple task.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.210
Now, I'll give you another challenge that you have to do it by yourself.

03:31.230 --> 03:33.270
I'll explain something about the challenge.

03:33.480 --> 03:40.020
See, usually we find that this email address can have characters.

03:40.980 --> 03:47.880
Characters on every website we find this it can have characters and it can have numbers, right?

03:48.180 --> 03:54.880
And in special characters only underscore is allowed or dot is allowed.

03:54.930 --> 03:57.060
No special characters are allowed.

03:57.270 --> 04:02.100
So you have to write a program to check this user name as valid or not.

04:02.410 --> 04:08.610
Means it should not have the letters outside this valid letters, and so it should have only characters

04:08.610 --> 04:09.060
numbers.

04:09.060 --> 04:13.830
And if there are any special characters, it should have only these two special characters.

04:13.830 --> 04:18.450
And these letters can be even in capital letters or small letters, it can be anything.

04:18.990 --> 04:21.150
So write a program for this one.

04:22.190 --> 04:23.470
So that's all in this video.
