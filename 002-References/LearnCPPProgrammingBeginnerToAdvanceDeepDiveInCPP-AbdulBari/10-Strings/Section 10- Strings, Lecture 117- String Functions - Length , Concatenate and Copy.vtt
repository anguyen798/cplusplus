00:00.430 --> 00:04.630
In this video, we will learn about functions upon string.

00:05.560 --> 00:07.690
There's a header file called C string.

00:07.990 --> 00:10.480
Even you can use string dot edge.

00:12.340 --> 00:15.760
These Hydrofoils are having some built in functions.

00:16.330 --> 00:24.280
With that, you can perform some operations on string and this is a string using a character or a string

00:24.280 --> 00:25.720
using a pointer.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.940
Let us look at the functions.

00:27.940 --> 00:28.990
I'll show you function.

00:28.990 --> 00:32.410
And also I will give a demonstration of each function.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.090
So here, this is an array.

00:35.110 --> 00:38.530
Let us call this as string one, str one.

00:38.530 --> 00:41.920
And if you want to find out the length of this string.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.720
So the length of this string is.

00:43.750 --> 00:47.980
This is one, two, three, four, five letters are there.

00:47.980 --> 00:49.510
So the length is five.

00:50.290 --> 00:54.900
And if you see the indices, the indices are from zero and the last index is five.

00:54.910 --> 00:57.790
But at that index, none character is present.

00:57.790 --> 01:00.820
So total five alphabets are there in this string.

01:01.210 --> 01:05.190
So there is a function called string length Australian.

01:05.200 --> 01:09.160
Using this you can find out the length of any string.

01:11.280 --> 01:13.260
Let us see the demonstration for this one.

01:14.160 --> 01:20.460
Here I have a skeleton of a program in which already I have declared an array and assign it with some

01:20.460 --> 01:20.790
string.

01:20.790 --> 01:21.330
Hello.

01:21.930 --> 01:23.940
So let us call that function.

01:23.940 --> 01:25.890
So for that I will include.

01:28.180 --> 01:29.380
CS sprinkler.

01:29.860 --> 01:30.340
Sorry.

01:32.730 --> 01:36.480
See, Sting had a fight, so Sea Sting is included.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.060
You can call that function.

01:39.060 --> 01:46.590
So I will say sea out star alien and the sting is SW.

01:47.250 --> 01:50.160
So also I will use NULL for a new line.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.090
Let us run it.

01:54.370 --> 01:54.580
Yes.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.310
Here you can see that land this five.

01:59.790 --> 02:00.510
I will.

02:01.580 --> 02:04.670
Write more in the string hello world.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.110
Now let us run and see.

02:08.300 --> 02:13.720
So add 11 alphabets, five for hello and five for World and there is a space also.

02:13.730 --> 02:16.550
So altogether 11 characters are there.

02:16.550 --> 02:19.370
So the length of first string is 11.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.390
Let me do it using a pointer to a string.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.670
So I will take a pointer to a string.

02:25.670 --> 02:27.770
Then I will say see out.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.470
Enter a string.

02:32.890 --> 02:39.100
Then I will use the scene and say s so this will be reading only one word.

02:39.190 --> 02:44.260
Now whatever the string entered from the keyboard, I'll be displaying the length of that string.

02:44.260 --> 02:51.520
So here I will include a message that is length and string length.

02:51.730 --> 02:53.680
So here I can get the string length.

02:54.850 --> 02:57.430
So here I have taken a pointer to a string.

02:57.440 --> 02:58.680
Then I'm using scene.

02:58.690 --> 03:01.030
I'm reading a string.

03:01.150 --> 03:02.230
Let us run it.

03:03.810 --> 03:04.500
Here.

03:04.690 --> 03:05.940
Interesting.

03:06.420 --> 03:10.470
So I'll give a string programming.

03:11.740 --> 03:14.950
There are 11 characters in this one length.

03:14.970 --> 03:15.550
11.

03:17.900 --> 03:19.090
I'll give you a string.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.200
That is holiday.

03:22.050 --> 03:23.430
Seven letters are there.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.470
I'll try it once again.

03:25.470 --> 03:27.240
I'll try to type two words.

03:27.450 --> 03:28.440
Hello, world.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.330
Five letters only.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.660
It is saying that the length of a string is five.

03:32.670 --> 03:34.220
So actually it is taking only.

03:34.230 --> 03:35.010
Hello.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.190
Already we saw that it will not take multiple words.

03:38.190 --> 03:40.920
So by using scene, let us try this.

03:40.920 --> 03:41.580
Using.

03:42.460 --> 03:44.140
Get or get line.

03:44.650 --> 03:48.550
See in dot get line.

03:50.400 --> 03:54.450
And the sizes handed maximum size.

03:54.990 --> 03:57.270
Hello world.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.210
Yes, it is working.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.140
So if you get line and give multiple words, it will work.

04:05.880 --> 04:09.240
So this is about string lend function.

04:10.470 --> 04:12.510
Let us continue with the next function.

04:13.260 --> 04:15.690
Next function is string cat.

04:15.720 --> 04:18.730
This is for concatenating two strings.

04:18.750 --> 04:22.370
So you have to pass two strings as parameters.

04:22.380 --> 04:24.720
That is two character type arrays as parameters.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.210
First is destination.

04:26.220 --> 04:27.420
Second one is four.

04:27.420 --> 04:29.850
So it will concatenate two strings.

04:30.030 --> 04:32.580
So first is destination this one, right?

04:32.880 --> 04:36.330
It is already having string that is written as good.

04:36.840 --> 04:40.680
Then there is one more string that is having word.

04:40.680 --> 04:41.650
Morning.

04:41.670 --> 04:43.470
I want to combine these two.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.770
This two, I want to combine and store the result in this one.

04:46.950 --> 04:53.310
So how it should work as after this end of the first string, that is it is ending at D, then it should

04:53.310 --> 04:54.950
start writing morning here.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.360
So morning should be written here.

04:57.990 --> 05:01.600
And then after the end of this null character should be included.

05:01.620 --> 05:05.040
So this is what happens when you say concatenate a string.

05:05.040 --> 05:10.890
So this string will be attached to the end of the string and the continuation of this one, and it will

05:10.890 --> 05:13.140
form a single large string.

05:13.900 --> 05:19.000
And there is one more version of string concatenation that is STR and the CAT.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.950
So a letter end is included here.

05:21.070 --> 05:27.040
You can mention how many characters you want to concatenate from this second string that is so string

05:27.040 --> 05:28.060
that is modeling.

05:28.060 --> 05:29.980
Suppose you want only three letters.

05:29.980 --> 05:35.860
So this model will be concatenated with this code that is destination.

05:35.860 --> 05:40.210
So you can mention what length of the source you want to concatenate.

05:40.420 --> 05:42.880
So let us see the demonstration of this one.

05:44.530 --> 05:48.340
I already have a skeleton of a program containing two strings that is SW.

05:48.340 --> 05:51.400
One is having good and SW two is having morning.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.710
So I will use STR.

05:55.270 --> 05:56.020
Kat.

05:56.230 --> 05:59.080
Then I will say as one comma as to.

06:00.330 --> 06:02.760
Then I will print as one.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.970
So this morning should be included in this.

06:10.970 --> 06:11.420
Good.

06:11.510 --> 06:12.740
Let us see this.

06:14.610 --> 06:18.930
Yes, but I print S1 so it is a new thing now that is.

06:18.930 --> 06:19.860
Good morning.

06:20.510 --> 06:22.730
So this is what concatenation is.

06:24.290 --> 06:30.860
Now I have shown you there is one more version that screen and you can mention the number of alphabets.

06:30.860 --> 06:33.560
So I will take just three alphabets and I will run.

06:35.330 --> 06:37.570
So good and more, right?

06:37.670 --> 06:43.250
Only three letters are concatenated from this second string that is source of string.

06:43.880 --> 06:45.800
So that's all about concatenation.

06:45.800 --> 06:47.430
Let us go to the next function.

06:47.450 --> 06:49.130
Next function is string.

06:49.130 --> 06:49.820
Copy.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.210
This will copy the contents of one string to another string.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.430
So this is the source and this is a destination.

06:55.430 --> 06:58.370
So I want the contents of this source to be copied here.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.900
So this is having a string.

06:59.900 --> 07:00.500
Hello.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.350
So this hello should be copied here as it is.

07:04.070 --> 07:05.210
So hello.

07:05.210 --> 07:06.890
And then null character.

07:06.980 --> 07:11.420
So as it is, the same string will be copied in destination array also.

07:11.420 --> 07:12.920
So it needs to parameters.

07:12.920 --> 07:17.830
The first one where we want the copy to be and from source from where you want to copy.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.180
So from this side it will be copied in this one.

07:21.040 --> 07:25.090
So again, there is one more version that is SDR and CP VI.

07:25.120 --> 07:29.560
So in this you can mention how many letters you want to copy from here to here.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.750
Suppose you don't want to copy the entire string.

07:31.750 --> 07:36.360
You want to copy part of a string so you can mention how many letters you want to copy.

07:36.370 --> 07:37.750
That is length of a string.

07:38.770 --> 07:40.260
Let us see the demo of this one.

07:40.270 --> 07:41.980
We are here in this program already.

07:41.980 --> 07:43.150
I have two strings.

07:43.150 --> 07:46.810
One is having content that is good and next is empty.

07:47.440 --> 07:51.280
So now I will call this function still CB vi.

07:52.270 --> 07:55.270
Then the destination is S2 then sources.

07:55.270 --> 07:59.170
S1 So the contents of S1 should be copied in this too.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.660
So let us print S2 and see.

08:03.190 --> 08:03.870
And I'll.

08:05.150 --> 08:06.860
So here I am printing as to.

08:08.860 --> 08:09.970
Let us run this.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.530
Yes it has printed.

08:12.650 --> 08:17.060
So the contents of S1 are copied in S2.

08:18.110 --> 08:24.380
As I said, there is one more version of string copy that is str and p v.

08:24.380 --> 08:27.470
So I should mention how many letters I want to copy.

08:27.470 --> 08:29.120
So I'll say just two letters.

08:29.120 --> 08:29.990
So it will copy.

08:29.990 --> 08:30.980
Just go.

08:31.010 --> 08:31.850
That is go.

08:32.390 --> 08:33.680
Let us run it and see.

08:34.650 --> 08:35.220
Yes.

08:35.220 --> 08:39.300
Only two alphabets are copied from string one to string two.

08:39.510 --> 08:43.320
So this is about string copy copying one string to another string.
