00:00.790 --> 00:02.800
Now let us look at the next function.

00:02.980 --> 00:05.560
This replacing a string.

00:06.760 --> 00:08.500
Suppose I have a string.

00:08.500 --> 00:09.970
I will take an example.

00:11.010 --> 00:12.630
Strength still.

00:13.780 --> 00:14.800
I will say.

00:16.410 --> 00:17.430
Programming.

00:19.310 --> 00:20.870
Strenuous programming.

00:21.600 --> 00:24.000
Now here I will say replace.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.560
I please.

00:26.600 --> 00:27.180
Right.

00:27.210 --> 00:30.510
And I want to replace it with some letters.

00:30.840 --> 00:34.410
Letters C, k, k, two letters I have.

00:34.980 --> 00:39.190
Now, this should be replaced with what if I take this as zero?

00:39.210 --> 00:42.540
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:42.540 --> 00:43.650
So I have to confirm this.

00:43.650 --> 00:44.050
This.

00:44.490 --> 00:49.070
Now I want to replace this k k with these alphabets.

00:49.080 --> 00:49.620
Right?

00:49.650 --> 00:50.340
G.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.840
R a m.

00:52.110 --> 00:55.980
So what is the index of g three then?

00:55.980 --> 00:57.890
How many alphabets I want to replace?

00:57.900 --> 00:59.760
One, two, three, four.

00:59.790 --> 01:01.560
So I should mention four here.

01:02.650 --> 01:05.760
So this kick will be replaced at this place.

01:05.770 --> 01:07.320
Gram will change to kick.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.330
So it will look like this.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.900
PR 0kk.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.240
Then am I and g.

01:15.350 --> 01:15.840
Right.

01:15.950 --> 01:19.790
So this is how you can replace a substring inside one of the main string.

01:20.540 --> 01:22.430
So let us run this and see.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.680
I have a string here already.

01:24.740 --> 01:26.060
Programming is given.

01:26.210 --> 01:30.290
Now I will say str dot replace.

01:32.320 --> 01:41.180
Replaced with indexes is three and I want total for alphabets to be replaced with this.

01:41.230 --> 01:41.500
K.

01:41.500 --> 01:41.950
K.

01:42.550 --> 01:43.630
Let us run this.

01:47.380 --> 01:47.920
Yeah.

01:47.950 --> 01:49.050
I got a strange PR.

01:49.150 --> 01:49.730
Okay.

01:50.140 --> 01:50.580
G.

01:53.730 --> 01:55.050
I'll change it a little bit.

01:55.140 --> 01:59.010
I want total six alphabets to be replaced with just.

02:00.990 --> 02:01.650
Each.

02:05.420 --> 02:09.420
Just at index three, it has started taking edge.

02:09.460 --> 02:12.200
Then after that, it has cleared off remaining alphabets.

02:12.590 --> 02:17.990
That is total six alphabets has gone and the remaining that is an g are appearing next.

02:18.680 --> 02:24.160
So if I count, this is one, two, three, four, five, six.

02:24.170 --> 02:26.000
So this is replaced with edge.

02:26.240 --> 02:27.440
So that's it.

02:27.890 --> 02:33.250
This type of operations we find in text editors like Notepad or MMS word, right?

02:33.260 --> 02:36.890
So similarly, you can do it for your programming in your program.

02:37.670 --> 02:39.680
Let us look at next function.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.630
So here we have completed.

02:41.630 --> 02:43.080
The next function is erase.

02:43.100 --> 02:46.580
This is just like clear that you have explained in the previous video.

02:46.580 --> 02:48.350
Clear, clear of the entire string.

02:48.350 --> 02:50.660
So this is this will clear the string.

02:50.690 --> 02:51.950
It is a string.

02:52.100 --> 02:53.240
Then these are simple.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.410
Just I'll finish them.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.110
Push back.

02:57.120 --> 03:01.340
So this will insert a single character at the end of a string.

03:03.170 --> 03:05.270
Just a single character you can mention.

03:05.270 --> 03:07.570
And this will be inserted at the end of a string.

03:07.580 --> 03:08.600
Suppose you have.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.500
Hello.

03:09.500 --> 03:13.400
And you push back with the Z, then it will insert Z also.

03:14.770 --> 03:15.640
Then pop back.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.860
It will take out one of the characters from a string.

03:18.190 --> 03:22.560
So it is more like a static operation like you can push from the end.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.230
This is top end and you can delete some top end.

03:25.240 --> 03:27.600
So it is a matter of just single alphabet.

03:27.610 --> 03:29.310
This is for one single alphabet.

03:29.320 --> 03:31.890
So even you can call it as a backspace.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.400
It's more like backspace.

03:33.850 --> 03:37.210
When you hit backspace from your keyboard, one of the letters will be gone.

03:37.210 --> 03:38.410
So it's more like that.

03:39.900 --> 03:41.480
Then this is swap.

03:41.490 --> 03:52.140
So it will swap two strings if you have two strings, string STR, one or S1 and this is having a and

03:52.140 --> 03:53.490
there is one more string.

03:54.940 --> 03:55.420
True.

03:55.990 --> 04:01.300
And this is having b, b, b, then you can swap these two strings.

04:01.300 --> 04:04.360
So this baby will go into S1 and that will come here.

04:05.230 --> 04:07.910
I will show you all these three functions, including this.

04:07.930 --> 04:08.620
It is.

04:08.620 --> 04:10.960
Let us look at the demonstration for these.

04:12.420 --> 04:16.320
I have a string here that is programming and I will say strict.

04:16.680 --> 04:17.640
It is.

04:19.080 --> 04:19.920
Let us run.

04:20.340 --> 04:21.680
It will be an empty string.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.070
It will be cleared off.

04:23.670 --> 04:25.920
That's the same as clear.

04:26.460 --> 04:28.260
Now the next function is strong.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.570
Push back.

04:30.690 --> 04:31.650
So push back.

04:31.650 --> 04:34.170
I want to insert a letter.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.100
That is.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.150
Atch.

04:37.270 --> 04:40.810
I will just insert some random letter and see what happens.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.310
Programming each so you can insert just a single letter.

04:46.340 --> 04:48.180
I try to give it a string.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.480
Let us see whether it will accept or not.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.130
No, it's an error.

04:53.660 --> 04:56.720
See, there is no such function which takes a string.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.440
So it should be a single alphabet.

04:59.450 --> 05:03.020
So you can insert the alphabet after the end of a string.

05:03.560 --> 05:07.220
Now, if I call another function that is up back.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.560
Got Pop back now.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.470
It will take out one of the litter from a string that is G.

05:15.590 --> 05:16.820
This letter will be gone.

05:19.630 --> 05:20.620
Let us run it.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.710
Yes, JI is gone from this one.

05:24.720 --> 05:28.350
So it will take out the last letter from a string, just like backspace.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.150
I will take two strings.

05:31.570 --> 05:38.110
This is programming and this is star two as.

05:39.820 --> 05:40.900
Language?

05:41.530 --> 05:43.540
No, I will try to swap them.

05:43.540 --> 05:44.890
So I will say.

05:46.050 --> 05:51.810
SDR one dot swap with SDR to.

05:55.210 --> 05:57.440
And I will print str one here.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.880
I will print this tr one.

05:59.390 --> 05:59.780
Right.

05:59.780 --> 06:03.380
So right now is tr one is programming, but it should become language.

06:05.830 --> 06:07.810
Yes, it has became language.

06:08.050 --> 06:12.310
So after SDR one, I will also print SDR two.

06:12.340 --> 06:16.510
Then you can see that they are swapped with one another.

06:17.670 --> 06:19.380
Let us make it as straight to.

06:22.780 --> 06:25.630
Yes, this became language and this became programming.

06:26.200 --> 06:29.090
So that's all about a few functions from string class.

06:29.090 --> 06:34.540
So I suggest you you try these functions and test them and if you remember them, then you can use them

06:34.540 --> 06:35.360
properly.

06:35.380 --> 06:38.770
So there are a few more operations I will show them in the next video.
