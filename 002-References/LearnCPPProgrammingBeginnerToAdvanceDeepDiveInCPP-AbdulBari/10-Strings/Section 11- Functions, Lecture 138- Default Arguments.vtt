yea in this video we will learn about default argument and so for explaining that I have taken two functions 

1
00:07.260 --> 00:13.850
here both these function names are ADD but two integers and three integers.

2
00:14.040 --> 00:20.610
So yes they are over loaded function with same name and different number of arguments

3
00:20.850 --> 00:22.090
what they are doing.

4
00:22.380 --> 00:27.340
They are adding numbers, this is adding two numbers this is adding three numbers.

5
00:27.390 --> 00:36.530
So let me write main function. main I'm not writing void in everything so just I will say integer

6
00:36.530 --> 00:47.370
in C assign add 2, 5 so which function it will call, it will call the first function. now C assign

7
00:47.490 --> 00:54.000
add 2 5 8 which function it will call it will call the second function.

8
00:55.470 --> 01:00.030
So just the number of parameters are different and here it is  working this little bit different

9
01:00.570 --> 01:01.980
but I will show you one more thing.

10
01:02.030 --> 01:03.160
Can't I say this add.

11
01:03.360 --> 01:12.510
and say 2, 5, 0  which function will be called first but what results it will be giving.

12
01:12.510 --> 01:14.210
Same as the first function.

13
01:14.340 --> 01:15.310
Same as this one 2. 5.

14
01:15.420 --> 01:18.880
because the third argument i made it as zero.

15
01:18.990 --> 01:24.210
So if I am ready to pass the third argument as zero then I dont need the first function. come to the

16
01:24.210 --> 01:24.980
point.

17
01:25.020 --> 01:29.140
Can I combine these two functions and write a single function.

18
01:29.220 --> 01:50.240
Let us see, int ADD  int X int Y, int Z assigned with zero and return x plus y plus Z.

19
01:50.430 --> 01:58.710
Now imagine they don't have these functions, then what I have done here I have assign some default value

20
01:58.710 --> 02:03.550
to this argument with in the argument list only and said that Z is zero.

21
02:05.450 --> 02:09.500
So if I call ADD same function would be called.

22
02:09.740 --> 02:16.880
So this two goes into x and 5 goes into Y and Z will become Zero because I'm not passing it.

23
02:16.970 --> 02:21.810
Second time 2 5 8, 2 5 8, Z will take the value 8.

24
02:22.040 --> 02:28.580
So this means this argument, this parameter it becomes optional.

25
02:29.300 --> 02:31.590
If you don't pass it here it will take 0.

26
02:31.610 --> 02:34.400
If you pass it then it will take that argument.

27
02:34.400 --> 02:38.620
So Even when I pass this Zero, already  it was only so it will take zero.

28
02:38.700 --> 02:39.800
and I get the result.

29
02:39.800 --> 02:43.670
So it means I have  combine these two functions.

30
02:43.670 --> 02:48.120
You see the one which is taking two arguments, the one which is taking three argument.

31
02:48.270 --> 02:52.680
So a single function can work as 2 argument  function also.

32
02:52.730 --> 02:54.260
3 argument function also.

33
02:54.500 --> 02:58.990
So I have combined these two over loaded function and return one function.

34
02:59.000 --> 03:02.080
So this is called as default argument.

35
03:02.160 --> 03:07.370
So assigning some default values to the argument is default argument function and the benefit

36
03:07.370 --> 03:13.900
of a different argument is you can combine the overloaded function and write one single function so

37
03:13.900 --> 03:18.630
this is a very powerful feature of C++ and it is friendly for the programmer.

38
03:18.660 --> 03:24.110
But he can combine various overloaded functions and write them as a single function with the help of

39
03:24.110 --> 03:26.670
default arguments.

40
03:26.670 --> 03:32.390
Now one important thing about this one suppose if you have one function, let's say function fun and you

41
03:32.390 --> 03:39.200
are picking some arguments A B C and D.

42
03:39.610 --> 03:46.870
And if you want to make a default then you should make default this one or this one you cannot make

43
03:46.870 --> 03:52.930
this as default  then skip this one make this as mandatory so whatever the default arguments are

44
03:53.090 --> 03:57.550
you can make this as Default, means  you should start making a Default argument from

45
03:57.560 --> 04:02.520
right towards left without skipping any. I will show you these things practically.

46
04:02.570 --> 04:03.610
Let us check it there.
