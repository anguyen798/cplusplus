00:00.970 --> 00:08.830
Now our next challenge is to count the number of vowels, consonants and number of words in a string.

00:09.220 --> 00:11.340
So here I have an example string.

00:11.350 --> 00:15.870
A string is containing lowercase with wobbles as well as uppercase.

00:15.890 --> 00:20.050
So also the few letters are uppercase and the spaces are also there.

00:20.050 --> 00:27.220
So total three words are here and I have not taken any special characters or numbers in this one.

00:28.330 --> 00:29.980
Now let us solve this problem.

00:30.520 --> 00:31.660
I have to count vowels.

00:31.660 --> 00:32.770
So what are vowels?

00:33.460 --> 00:37.450
A e, i, o and you?

00:37.480 --> 00:38.530
These are vowels.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.870
Even these are also models.

00:42.320 --> 00:42.820
Right.

00:42.830 --> 00:48.470
So what I mean is if it is an uppercase or lowercase, so it could be in any case.

00:48.500 --> 00:53.660
So we have to check whether it's a vowel in lowercase as well as uppercase.

00:53.660 --> 00:54.980
You have to consider both.

00:55.310 --> 00:58.580
So while scanning a string, you should check for both of these.

00:59.330 --> 01:06.880
Now, if it is not a vowel, then there are two possibilities in this example string that it is a consonant,

01:06.890 --> 01:07.190
right?

01:07.310 --> 01:08.540
It's a consonant.

01:08.570 --> 01:10.730
Or it may be a space.

01:10.760 --> 01:11.800
It may be a space.

01:11.810 --> 01:13.040
This is a blank space.

01:14.110 --> 01:19.800
So if it is a blank space, then it means there is a new word starting now.

01:19.870 --> 01:20.980
Again, blank space.

01:20.980 --> 01:22.720
So only a word is a starting.

01:23.420 --> 01:30.380
So in this thing there are total three words and there are two spaces.

01:30.620 --> 01:34.370
So two spaces are there means there are three words.

01:34.460 --> 01:38.150
So this is the idea we have now, right now for our example, string.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.760
So if there is a space, then there is a new work.

01:40.850 --> 01:45.030
So you have to count the number of words means you have to count the number of spaces.

01:45.050 --> 01:48.770
If you've got two spaces, then there are three words.

01:49.750 --> 01:55.510
So for this example, string, how to find out this vowels and consonants and words.

01:55.510 --> 01:57.160
So I'll give the idea here.

01:57.160 --> 02:01.570
You have to scan through the string from left to right by checking each and every character.

02:01.570 --> 02:02.870
We have already done that.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.030
How to scan a string.

02:04.030 --> 02:08.590
We know it very well now while scanning what you should do check for wobble.

02:09.130 --> 02:13.730
If it is a wobble, then count it or add one good.

02:14.290 --> 02:19.090
And if there are spaces, if it is a space, then count one to it.

02:19.180 --> 02:19.720
Right?

02:20.440 --> 02:22.900
So counter space plus one.

02:23.350 --> 02:27.400
Otherwise, just you can count it as a consonant.

02:27.430 --> 02:28.030
Right.

02:32.600 --> 02:33.860
Are you concerned?

02:34.430 --> 02:38.660
We don't have any special characters or extra spaces.

02:39.350 --> 02:41.510
Now, let us talk about checking of this one.

02:41.510 --> 02:46.550
So for checking a bubble, you have to check whether a letter is any of these.

02:46.550 --> 02:53.240
So you have to write a very lengthy condition where the letter is Capital A or E or I or O.

02:53.240 --> 02:57.860
So you have to check it for all four uppercase as well as lowercase.

02:57.860 --> 03:01.580
Then for space, just you have to give a space in between single course.

03:01.610 --> 03:02.900
This is very easy.

03:02.930 --> 03:04.550
Otherwise it's a consonant.

03:06.420 --> 03:08.340
So you can write on the program.

03:08.340 --> 03:10.330
Now, I have given you the idea.

03:10.350 --> 03:12.650
So write a program by yourself.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.610
So pause the video and try it.

03:16.540 --> 03:18.730
If you want help, you can continue the video.

03:18.760 --> 03:20.170
You will find the solution.

03:20.470 --> 03:25.840
I will read on the program and show you after giving the solution for this one, I'll give you one more

03:25.840 --> 03:27.730
problem that you have to do it by yourself.

03:27.730 --> 03:29.980
So watch this video till end.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.020
Now here is a string.

03:32.020 --> 03:33.300
I have taken the same string.

03:33.310 --> 03:36.180
Now I have to count wobbles, so and consonants.

03:36.180 --> 03:37.660
So I will declare some variable.

03:40.840 --> 03:41.440
What else?

03:41.470 --> 03:52.330
That is initialize to zero and consonant is also initialized to zero and space or OC I will call it

03:52.330 --> 03:53.350
as space.

03:53.350 --> 03:55.450
And this is also initialized to zero.

03:55.990 --> 04:00.610
Now I have to scan through this string and check for those letters.

04:00.610 --> 04:12.790
So for this I will say digit is zero and str of I is not equal to null character and I plus plus.

04:14.070 --> 04:14.610
No.

04:14.610 --> 04:16.450
I have to check whether survival or not.

04:16.470 --> 04:25.590
So if star of I is equal to capital A then or.

04:26.570 --> 04:28.210
I have to check for another thing.

04:28.220 --> 04:29.180
For every letter.

04:29.180 --> 04:30.050
I should do this.

04:30.080 --> 04:37.040
So what I do now is, instead of typing this entire thing, I'll copy this and I will list it just for

04:37.040 --> 04:37.580
E!

04:39.260 --> 04:45.350
I owe you the lowercase a e I owe you.

04:45.680 --> 04:46.100
Right.

04:46.550 --> 04:48.980
So I'll just change the letters.

04:49.730 --> 04:51.380
This is Capital E.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.920
Kept an eye.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.360
Capital.

04:55.370 --> 04:55.960
Oh.

04:57.650 --> 04:58.490
And capital.

04:58.490 --> 05:03.950
You then hear lowercase a lowercase e.

05:04.220 --> 05:05.580
Lowercase I.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.700
Lowercase o and lowercase.

05:08.720 --> 05:09.200
You.

05:10.430 --> 05:13.850
Now, if this are the case, then I will say.

05:15.050 --> 05:15.410
Plus.

05:15.410 --> 05:16.140
Plus.

05:16.580 --> 05:17.300
That's it.

05:17.960 --> 05:19.580
Then else.

05:20.440 --> 05:26.640
If this is not the case, if it's not a waffle, then I said I have to check only for the space so as

05:26.650 --> 05:27.450
to verify.

05:27.460 --> 05:30.790
Already I have copied it so I will just simply paste it here.

05:31.180 --> 05:32.920
I have to check for a space.

05:33.190 --> 05:33.940
So.

05:34.810 --> 05:37.960
This should be a space in between single course, right?

05:38.230 --> 05:39.640
So space.

05:40.690 --> 05:40.950
Plus.

05:40.960 --> 05:41.740
Plus.

05:42.620 --> 05:43.280
Else.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.650
I'm assuming that it's a consonant.

05:49.700 --> 05:50.300
Consonant.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.320
Plus, plus.

05:52.380 --> 05:54.300
Let's hope so.

05:54.300 --> 05:59.370
I'm counting vowels and spaces and consonants.

05:59.850 --> 06:02.970
So now here I will print.

06:05.220 --> 06:06.990
What else are?

06:07.350 --> 06:08.820
So how many of us are there?

06:09.390 --> 06:11.340
Whatever we get in this one.

06:11.370 --> 06:12.020
Right.

06:12.030 --> 06:15.480
So now I'll just copy this.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.570
And paste tier two times.

06:19.930 --> 06:20.920
Novels.

06:20.920 --> 06:22.890
Then words.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.610
So then.

06:25.660 --> 06:26.980
Consonants.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.990
So how many consonants are there?

06:29.350 --> 06:30.700
So I'll type here.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.900
Consonants, then words.

06:36.380 --> 06:38.810
So here I will say space plus one.

06:40.350 --> 06:41.310
Otherwise.

06:41.310 --> 06:44.390
If you don't want to write one here, then you should start from here.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.330
Right here.

06:45.330 --> 06:47.130
You should start space from one onwards.

06:47.130 --> 06:50.910
But initially we don't have any spaces, so it's better to start with zero.

06:50.910 --> 06:54.090
And here you have to show plus one for number of words.

06:54.690 --> 06:58.560
So let us first of all, count how many vowels are there?

06:58.560 --> 07:02.670
One, two and three vocals are there.

07:02.940 --> 07:04.440
So how many consonants?

07:04.440 --> 07:09.300
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, nine.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.380
Consonants are there.

07:10.380 --> 07:11.790
And there are three words.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.230
Three warbles nine consonants and three words.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.480
Yes, you got a perfect answer for this one.

07:20.840 --> 07:26.780
So this was a solution for counting words and vowels and consonants.

07:27.710 --> 07:31.660
Now next challenge that you are supposed to do it, you solve it by yourself.

07:31.670 --> 07:33.410
So I'll just remove this.

07:33.860 --> 07:34.430
Okay.

07:35.030 --> 07:35.990
I'll push it down.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.780
And here, I'll show you a new string.

07:38.810 --> 07:43.880
See if I have more spaces than how to handle this.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.400
So you have to find out a solution for this one.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.900
So it's a challenge for you.

07:47.930 --> 07:52.230
You can write the program by yourself if there are multiple spaces.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.740
See this logic?

07:53.750 --> 07:55.190
The one we have written here.

07:55.220 --> 08:00.370
If there are multiple space, then every space it will count and I have given for extra spaces.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.330
So right now the answer was three.

08:02.330 --> 08:08.060
So it will say plus four total seven words, but it's having actually three words.

08:08.060 --> 08:11.210
So if there are multiple words, then what you will do?

08:12.770 --> 08:14.630
So there are multiple spaces.

08:14.630 --> 08:15.660
Then what you'll do.

08:15.680 --> 08:17.810
So find out the solution.

08:18.470 --> 08:22.650
Now, next thing in this challenge is suppose here I have a number seven.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.760
See, this is not a consonant.

08:24.770 --> 08:25.640
It's a number.

08:25.760 --> 08:26.330
So what?

08:26.330 --> 08:30.590
Our program that we have written just now, it will simply count it as consonant.

08:30.590 --> 08:32.780
So it will take seven also as consonant.

08:32.780 --> 08:38.780
So you have to make sure that it's a uppercase consonant or it may be a lowercase consonant and you

08:38.780 --> 08:41.750
should count it as lower or uppercase consonant.

08:42.270 --> 08:42.770
Right.

08:43.040 --> 08:47.810
So if it is other than consonant, you should not count it.

08:48.170 --> 08:51.710
So these are the two conditions I have introduced.

08:51.740 --> 08:58.820
That is, if there are multiple spaces, then if there are any other special characters like words,

08:58.820 --> 09:02.510
hyphen seven, if hyphen, you should not count it as consonant.

09:03.290 --> 09:07.400
So you have to handle these two conditions and complete a challenge by yourself.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.610
That all practice these programs.
