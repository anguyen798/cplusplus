00:00.620 --> 00:05.960
Our next challenge is to convert a uppercase string into lowercase.

00:05.960 --> 00:12.770
So uppercase to lowercase here already I have a string and string is welcome all in uppercase.

00:13.340 --> 00:16.430
We have to convert this string into lowercase.

00:16.430 --> 00:17.840
So what is the procedure?

00:17.840 --> 00:18.920
How we can do this?

00:18.920 --> 00:19.400
Fun.

00:19.640 --> 00:25.190
So for this, we should be able to scan through this string character by character.

00:25.200 --> 00:29.680
We should be able to go through each and every character so that we can do it using for loop.

00:29.690 --> 00:33.890
Already we have seen it in the previous challenge or in some of the videos.

00:35.560 --> 00:39.130
Now how to convert a letter from uppercase to lowercase.

00:39.130 --> 00:50.380
So for this, if you know the ASCII code of capital, a uppercase is 65 and lowercase A is 97.

00:51.530 --> 00:55.810
And if you take the difference, it is -32.

00:55.820 --> 01:03.710
If I subtract all the difference is 32 means if a letter is in uppercase by adding 32, we can convert

01:03.710 --> 01:09.320
it into lowercase and if it is a lowercase, we can change it to uppercase.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.410
So the characters are stored as a numeric value.

01:12.440 --> 01:16.520
We can add a 32 or subtract 32 from the characters.

01:17.150 --> 01:23.510
So all these letters can be converted into lowercase by adding 32 to each of these characters.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.480
For that, we have to scan for all these characters.

01:26.480 --> 01:30.170
So by using a four loop, which we have already seen.

01:31.610 --> 01:33.770
We can scan through this string.

01:33.800 --> 01:34.370
Right.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.620
Start off, I.

01:37.510 --> 01:39.400
We can stop at null character.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.250
So I will not write this one so you can do it.

01:42.820 --> 01:46.810
And for every style of I, we should modify it.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.730
By adding 32.

01:50.180 --> 01:55.950
If everything is in uppercase, it should be converted into lowercase by adding 32.

01:55.970 --> 01:57.950
So this is how it can be converted.

01:58.430 --> 01:59.420
Now, one more thing.

02:00.280 --> 02:07.090
Whether all these letters are in uppercase only, we are sure that these are all in uppercase.

02:07.120 --> 02:11.110
If we are not sure, then it should check whether it is an uppercase or not.

02:11.590 --> 02:19.810
So the range of uppercase is 65 to 90, starts from 65 and ends at 19.

02:19.810 --> 02:26.750
So you should make sure that if a letter is having its ASCII code in between these two range values,

02:26.750 --> 02:32.380
the range of values, then only it is uppercase, then you can convert it into lowercase.

02:32.740 --> 02:38.980
But here, as an example, we will take everything in the case and simply we will convert it.

02:39.370 --> 02:44.050
If you are taking different cases, then you should make sure that you check the range.

02:44.050 --> 02:44.940
So that's it.

02:44.950 --> 02:49.450
This is a simple procedure, so you can pause the video and write the complete program.

02:49.450 --> 02:53.590
If you've got any mistakes and if you want help, you can continue playing this video.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.080
You will find the solution followed by this one.

02:56.740 --> 02:58.480
So pause the video and try it.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.640
So here is the solution.

03:00.640 --> 03:06.100
Already I have written a piece of code here, so a string is already declared here.

03:06.100 --> 03:12.760
Now let us scan through this by using a for loop and modify all the characters.

03:12.760 --> 03:23.470
So while Star of IE is not equal to null character, that is slash zero and I press plus and every time

03:23.470 --> 03:25.810
I have to say star of I.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.790
In that whatever the store of I is.

03:30.420 --> 03:33.900
AD 32 So the letters will be changed.

03:34.660 --> 03:35.230
So that's it.

03:35.230 --> 03:39.790
So if you remember the previous program there, we were counting, but now we are modifying a string

03:40.390 --> 03:41.590
outside the for loop.

03:41.620 --> 03:43.270
I will print this one.

03:43.270 --> 03:46.960
See out SDR as well as NL.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.670
Let us run this.

03:50.380 --> 03:52.750
Yes it is converted into lowercase.

03:52.750 --> 03:55.210
So this is things converted into lowercase.

03:56.440 --> 03:58.570
So I have done it using followup.

03:58.960 --> 03:59.860
Now one more thing.

03:59.860 --> 04:04.150
I'll change one of the letter to lowercase c.

04:04.150 --> 04:04.900
Welcome.

04:04.900 --> 04:08.440
So I will make it in small and lowercase m.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.330
Now here I'm not checking anything.

04:10.330 --> 04:16.120
I'm simply converting into lowercase by adding 32, so it will simply add a 32.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.680
So this is what it will become.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.370
I don't know.

04:18.400 --> 04:22.330
I'll run and show you and will become something else.

04:24.130 --> 04:24.910
Yes.

04:26.980 --> 04:32.740
Some junkie character already was in lowercase, so 32 is added to it.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.260
So it has gone beyond the range of characters.

04:35.260 --> 04:38.740
So it's showing some Jun character so well.

04:38.900 --> 04:39.270
Well.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.280
Go is shown and then a character then is shown.

04:42.730 --> 04:46.430
So you have to make sure that whether everything is in capital letters or not.

04:46.450 --> 04:49.090
So for that, I can add one condition here.

04:49.480 --> 04:55.810
If Star of I is greater than or equal to 65.

04:56.650 --> 05:02.260
And still I should be less than or equal to 90.

05:02.560 --> 05:04.510
Then only modify this.

05:04.510 --> 05:06.220
Otherwise don't modify.

05:06.250 --> 05:09.400
So I will use braces brackets.

05:11.330 --> 05:12.920
I will use brackets.

05:14.540 --> 05:14.790
Jim.

05:15.020 --> 05:16.510
Now this is inside.

05:16.520 --> 05:20.120
So this will be perform only if letter is in uppercase.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.370
So I will get a perfect string.

05:22.370 --> 05:23.230
So welcome.

05:23.240 --> 05:23.760
Yes.

05:23.780 --> 05:28.400
Already something was in lowercase, so I'm checking the condition and modifying it.

05:29.540 --> 05:30.230
So that's it.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.790
So try this on your machine.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.320
Write the program and check it.

05:34.040 --> 05:39.350
Now, our next challenge is similar to the previous one, but here everything we have to convert it

05:39.350 --> 05:40.840
into uppercase.

05:40.850 --> 05:41.650
Here, the string.

05:41.660 --> 05:45.620
What I have taken is having mixed cases as well as numeric values.

05:45.620 --> 05:46.370
Also there.

05:46.460 --> 05:51.110
C is in lowercase and C is also lowercase and M is lowercase.

05:51.500 --> 05:51.860
Right.

05:51.860 --> 05:52.940
And there is a number.

05:53.570 --> 05:57.590
So I have to check whether a letter is already in uppercase.

05:57.590 --> 05:58.970
So don't change it.

05:59.210 --> 06:02.420
If it is in lowercase, then change it to uppercase.

06:02.540 --> 06:04.880
And if it is a number, then don't do anything.

06:04.880 --> 06:11.420
Let it be a number only, so don't modify it so we know how to change the case by adding or subtracting.

06:11.420 --> 06:11.900
32.

06:11.900 --> 06:12.470
Right.

06:12.470 --> 06:15.110
So here is already in capital letter.

06:15.110 --> 06:15.940
That is uppercase.

06:15.950 --> 06:16.550
Leave it.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.260
This is a lowercase.

06:18.260 --> 06:22.910
So from this if you subtract 32, then it will become uppercase.

06:22.910 --> 06:24.100
So this is the case.

06:24.110 --> 06:25.160
Leave it lowercase.

06:25.160 --> 06:25.880
Change it.

06:26.150 --> 06:27.350
So don't change.

06:27.350 --> 06:27.920
Change.

06:27.920 --> 06:28.790
Don't change.

06:28.970 --> 06:29.840
Now here.

06:29.870 --> 06:31.130
This is out of the range.

06:31.130 --> 06:32.900
It's neither lowercase nor uppercase.

06:32.900 --> 06:33.950
So don't touch it.

06:33.980 --> 06:34.910
Don't change it.

06:35.570 --> 06:42.200
So this is how you have to check whether it is lowercase or uppercase as well as if it is a number.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.220
We don't have to do anything.

06:43.220 --> 06:43.400
So.

06:44.090 --> 06:45.860
So you have to change lowercase.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.710
So check for lowercase and change it.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.960
If it is uppercase, you don't have to touch it.

06:50.960 --> 06:55.790
And if it is any other alphabet, any other symbol, then also you don't have to change it.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.680
So it's a very simple code.

06:57.950 --> 07:03.890
You have to scan through a string and if any lowercase is found, just change it so you can try this

07:03.890 --> 07:05.150
program by yourself.

07:05.810 --> 07:07.460
So post the video and do it.

07:08.590 --> 07:10.930
So after the video, I'll give a solution.

07:11.750 --> 07:12.050
Yeah.

07:12.050 --> 07:13.390
Let us write the program now.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.680
See, I have a string already taken here.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.390
This is having mixed cases.

07:17.390 --> 07:21.440
So as I told you all, we have to just modify this lowercase.

07:21.560 --> 07:23.480
We don't have to touch any other thing.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.810
So it is a simple program, just like a previous example.

07:26.810 --> 07:37.100
So we will scan, throw this array for integer assign I assign zero and str of I as not equal to null

07:37.100 --> 07:37.970
character.

07:38.970 --> 07:41.130
That A-plus plus.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.490
Now inside this, we have to check a condition.

07:44.490 --> 07:46.410
If it is a lowercase, then change it.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.420
So if it is a lower case.

07:48.870 --> 07:51.300
So the steer of I.

07:52.650 --> 07:59.010
If it is greater than or equal to 97 and store of I.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.120
Less than or equal to.

08:02.150 --> 08:05.660
So what is the last value in the range?

08:05.690 --> 08:06.920
It is 122.

08:08.940 --> 08:10.960
Now stratify.

08:11.340 --> 08:16.380
We should subtract 32 so we can also do it like this minus assign.

08:17.320 --> 08:22.210
32, so 32 will be subtracted and stored in str or off itself.

08:22.780 --> 08:27.760
Now after this saves out str and nl.

08:30.730 --> 08:37.600
Yes, everything is converted into uppercase and number seven remains as it is.

08:37.600 --> 08:43.100
So we are only changing lowercase alphabets to uppercase, that's all.

08:43.120 --> 08:47.170
So it's a simple solution so you can try this program.
