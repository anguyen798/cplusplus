Given a string and a non-empty word string, set result to a version of the original string where all chars have been replaced by pluses ("+"), except for appearances of the word string which are preserved unchanged.

* for input of "12xy34", "xy" → "++xy++"
* for input of "12xy34", "1" → "1+++++"
* for input of "12xy34xyabcxy", "xy" → "++xy++xy+++xy"

```cpp
#include <string>
using std::string;

/**
 *  Given a string and a non-empty word string, set result 
 *  to a version of the original string where all chars 
 *  have been replaced by pluses ("+"), except for appearances 
 *  of the word string which are preserved unchanged.

string plus_out(const string& str, const string& word)
{
   string result = "not done";
   
  // Add your code here
   
   return result;
