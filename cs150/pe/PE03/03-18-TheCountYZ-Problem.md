Given an input string, count the number of words ending in 'y' or 'z' -so the 'y' in "heavy" and the 'z' in "fez" count, but not the 'y' in "yellow". Make sure that your comparison is not case sensitive. We'll say that a y or z is at the end of a word if there is not an alphabetic letter immediately following it.

* for input of "fez day" → 2
* for input of "day fez" → 2
* for input of "day fyyyz" → 2

```cpp
#include <string>
using std::string;

/**
