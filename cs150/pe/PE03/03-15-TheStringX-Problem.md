Given a string, set result to a version where all the "x" have been removed. Except an "x" at the very start or end should not be removed.

* for input of "xxHxix" → "xHix"
* for input of "abxxxcd" → "abcd"
* for input of "xabxxxcdx" → "xabcdx"

```cpp
#include <string>
using std::string;

/**
 *  Given a string, set result to a version 
 *  where all the "x" have been removed. Except an 
 *  "x" at the very start or end should not be removed.  
 */
string string_x(const string& str)
{
    string result;
  // Add your code here
   
    return result;
}
```
