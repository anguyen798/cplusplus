Given as input a string and an int n, set result to a string made of the first n characters of the string, followed by the first n-1 characters of the string, and so on. You may assume that n is between 0 and the length of the string, inclusive (i.e. n >= 0 and n <= str.length()).

* for input of "Chocolate", 4 â†’ "ChocChoChC"
* for input of "Chocolate", 3 â†’ "ChoChC"
* for input of "Ice Cream", 2 â†’ "IcI"

```cpp
#include <string>
using std::string;

/**
 *  Given a string and an int n, create a new string 
 *  made of the first n characters of the original 
 *  string, followed by the first n-1 characters of 
 *  the original string, and so on. You may assume
