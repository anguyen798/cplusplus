Set result to a version of the given string, where for every star (\*) in the input string the star and the chars immediately to its left and right are gone. So "ab\*cd" yields "ad" and "ab**cd" also yields "ad".

* for input of "ab*cd" → "ad"
* for input of "ab**cd" → "ad"
* for input of "sm*eilly" → "silly"
