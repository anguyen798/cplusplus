Given two input strings, base and remove, set result to a version of the base string where all instances of the remove string have been removed. You may assume that the remove string is length 1 or more. Remove only non-overlapping instances, so with "xxx" removing "xx" leaves "x".

* for input of "Hello there", "llo" → "He there"
* for input of "Hello there", "e" → "Hllo thr"
* for input of "Hello there", "x" → "Hello there"

```cpp
#include <string>
#include <cctype>
using namespace std;

/**
