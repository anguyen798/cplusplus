Given an input string, set result to the length of the largest "block" in the string. A block is a run of adjacent chars that are the same.

* for input of "hoopla" → 2
* for input of "abbCCCddBBBxx" → 3
* for input of "" → 0

```cpp
#include <string>
using std::string;

/**
 *  Given an input string, set result to the length of
 *  the largest "block" in the string. A block is a run
 *  of adjacent chars that are the same.
 *  Do not use any string functions except for substr(),
 *  at(), and size().
 */
int max_run(const string& str)
{
   int result;
   // Add your code here

   return result;
}
```
