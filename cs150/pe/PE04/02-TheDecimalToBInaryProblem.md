// Write a function named decToBin() that accepts an integer parameter whose digits are meant to represent decimal (base-10) digits, and converts that integer to a representation of binary (base-2). The function should return the integer value before it was converted. For example, given this code:

// int a = 43;
// int b = decToBin(a);
// cout << "a->" << a << ", b->" << b << endl;

// The output is: a->101011, b->43

// Constraints: Do not use a string in your solution. Also do not use any built-in base conversion functions from the system libraries. You must program this by "hand".
