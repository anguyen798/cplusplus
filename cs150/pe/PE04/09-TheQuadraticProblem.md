// Write a function named quadratic() that computes roots of quadratic equations. Recall that a quadratic equation is one of the form, ax2 + bx + c = 0.

// Your function accepts five parameters:
// * The integer coefficients a, b, and c as two input parameters
// * Two real number (double) output parameters root1 and root2.

// Your function should compute the two integer roots of the quadratic equation and store them into the two reference parameters. For example, the equation x2 - 3x - 4 = 0 has roots of x = 4 and x = -1, so the call quadratic(1, -3, -4, root1, root2); should set root1 to 4 and root2 to -1. You may assume that the function has two real roots.

// Recall the quadratic formula is:
// x = ( -b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ) / 2a
