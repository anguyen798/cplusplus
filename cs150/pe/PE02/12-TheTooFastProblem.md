// You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write code to compute the result, encoded as an int value: 0=no ticket, 25=small ticket, 275=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, there is no ticket. If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is a small ticket. If speed is 81 or more, the result is a large ticket. Unless it is your birthday-on that day, your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.

// * input of 60, birthday=false → 0
// * input of 65, birthday=false → 25
// * input of 65, birthday=true → 0
