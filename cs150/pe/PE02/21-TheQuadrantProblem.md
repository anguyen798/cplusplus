// Given a pair of real numbers representing an (x, y) point, print the quadrant number for that point. Recall that quadrants are numbered as integers from 1 to 4 with the upper-right quadrant numbered 1 and the subsequent quadrants numbered in a counter-clockwise fashion:

// Notice that the quadrant is determined by whether the x and y coordinates are positive or negative numbers. If a point falls on the x-axis or the y-axis, then quadrant is 0.

// Here are some samples:
// * for input of 12.4, 17.8 → 1
// * for input of -2.3, 3.5 → 2
// * for input of -15.2, -3.1 → 3
// * for input of 4.5, -42.0 → 4
// * for input of 0.0, 3.14 → 0
