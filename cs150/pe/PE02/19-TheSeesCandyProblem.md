// We want to pack up a box of custom chocolate bars. We have some small chocolates (1 gram each) and some large chocolates (5 grams each). Each box will have a goal. Print the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. Print -1 if it can't be done.

// * for input of small=4, large=1, goal=9 → 4
