// Given 3 int values, a b c, print their sum. However, if any of the values is a teen-in the range 13..19 inclusive- then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens. You may write a separate helper function if you like. Define the helper above the problem function.

// * input of 1, 2, 3 → 6
// * input of 2, 13, 1 → 3
// * input of 2, 1, 14 → 3
