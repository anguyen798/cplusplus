// Given as input a day of the week encoded as 0=Sun, 1=Mon, 2=Tue, ...6=Sat, and a boolean indicating if we are on vacation, print a string of the form "7:00" indicating when the alarm clock should ring. Weekdays, the alarm should be "7:00" and on the weekend it should be "10:00". Unless we are on vacation-then on weekdays it should be "10:00" and weekends it should be "off". Don't put quotes around your answer. I will do that.

// input of 1, false → "7:00"
// input of 5, false → "7:00"
// input of 0, false → "10:00"
