Given an int n, return the number followed by "!". So the int 6 returns "6!". Except if the number is divisible by 3 use "Fizz" instead of the number, and if the number is divisible by 5 use "Buzz", and if divisible by both 3 and 5, use "FizzBuzz". You can use to_string(n) to convert n into a string so you can concatenate.

* input of 1 → "1!"
* input of 2 → "2!"
* input of 3 → "Fizz!"
