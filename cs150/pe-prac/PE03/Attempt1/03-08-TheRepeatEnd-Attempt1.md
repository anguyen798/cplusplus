Given as input string and an int N, set result a string made of N repetitions of the last N characters of the string. You may assume that N is between 0 and the length of the string, inclusive.

* for input of "Hello", 3 → "llollollo"
* for input of "Hello", 2 → "lolo"
* for input of "Hello", 1 → "o"

```cpp
#include <string>
using std::string;

/**

 *  a string made of N repetitions of the last N characters 
 *  of the string. You may assume that N is between 0 and 
 *  the length of the string, inclusive.

string repeat_end(const string& str, int n)
{
   string result = "not done";
   
  // Add your code hre
