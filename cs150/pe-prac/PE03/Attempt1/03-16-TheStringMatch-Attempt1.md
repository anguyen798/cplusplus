Given 2 strings, a and b, set result to the number of the positions where they contain the same length 2 substring. So "xxcaazz" and "xxbaaz" yields 3, since the "xx", "aa", and "az" substrings appear in the same place in both strings.

* for input of "xxcaazz", "xxbaaz" → 3
* for input of "abc", "abc" → 2
* for input of "abc", "axc" → 0

```cpp
#include <string>
using std::string;

/**
