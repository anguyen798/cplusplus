Given a string and a non-empty word string, set result to a string made of each char just before and just after every appearance of the word in the string. Ignore cases where there is no char before or after the word, and a char may be included twice if it is between two words. Do not do any printing.

* for input of "abcXY123XYijk", "XY" → "c13i"
* for input of "XY123XY", "XY" → "13"
* for input of "XY1XY", "XY" → "11"

```cpp
#include <string>
using std::string;

/**
