#  I. Introducing C++
## ^I-Intro-IntroducingCpp

**This is the Course Reader for CS 150, C++ Programming I, at Orange Coast College**. CS 150 is a **second-semester** course for majors who have already taken a course covering variables, input and output, calculations, loops, decisions, functions and arrays.

The reader is short and concise, in line with Leonard Elmore's advice: "leave out the parts readers skip." It focuses on the parts you need to get your work done. To get more details, consult one of these highly recommended texts.

* **The C++ Primer, 5th Edition. Lippman**, Lajoie and Moo
* **The C++ Programming Language, 4th Edition**, Bjarne Stroustrup

These are **professional** books to keep on your shelf after the course is over. Throughout the text you'll also find links pointing to additional reading, which is ==**optional**==.

## A. The C++ Programming Language [[cs150-ch1#Chapter 1 Introducing C++| `I.`]]

C++ is a ==**compiled**==, high-level programming language. Compilers produce **native machine code** programs, which run directly on your hardware, without an [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)) (like Python) or intermediate software, such as the [Java Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine). Even though C++ programs are often more efficient than their Java or Python counterparts, certain kinds of errors cannot easily be detected, so you will find that you must be more careful and detail-oriented when writing programs in C++.

C++ is also a ==**standardized**== **language**, specified by the [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization_for_Standardization), or International Standards Organization. Unlike **proprietary languages**, controlled by a single company, **anyone** may implement the C++ language without fear of lawsuits. There are three versions of C++ you should know about.

* **Pre-standard C++**: 1980-98. Often incompatible versions, vendor specific.
* **C++ 98**: the first standard version; it was updated in 2003 (C++03).
* ==**C++ 11**==: the second major standard; it was updated in **C++14** and **C++ 17**.
* [C++20](https://isocpp.org/std/status), the latest major standard, is now **complete**. Most recent compilers offer a sampling of some of its new features.

In this class we will be using **C++ 17**. Compilers that implement C++17 include **Visual Studio 2019**, GNU **g++ 7** (or later), and **clang 6+**.

# II. Hello World
## ^II-Intro-HelloWorld

On the first page of **Dennis Ritchie**'s seminal programming book, **The C Programming Language**, he writes:
>The only way to learn a new programming language is by writing programs in it. The first program to write is the same for all languages:`
>
>Print the words: `hello, world`
>
>This is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where the output went. With these mechanical details mastered, everything else is comparatively easy.


I'm sure his last sentence was **somewhat** tongue-in-cheek, but let's follow his example and look at a C++ version of "Hello World" by clicking the little "running-man" to your left. Leave it open for the next few pages. (You must be logged into your GitHub account)

## A. The Source Code [[cs150-ch1#II. Hello World | `II.`]]
When you click the link and open the CS50 Sandbox, you'll find the human-readable source code for this program, in the file named hello.cpp.

```cpp
// A c++ version of hello world
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	cout << "hello world" << endl;
	return 0;
}
```

The .cpp extension is the naming convention that we will adopt. Let's review each line:
1. A ==comment==, designed for the reader, but ignored by the compiler.
2. A ==preprocessor directive== which makes the C++ library facilities available.
3. A ==namespace directive== makes standard names available without qualification.
4. A ==blank line==, used to make your code more readable.
5. The `main` function or ==entry point== to your program. Each program has **one** `main`.
6. The **opening** brace. How you say ==begin== the actions in C++.
7. Prints to the console, using the ==standard output== object named `cout`.
8. Ends the `main` function, ==returning== the value `0` back to the operating system.
9. The **closing** brace marks the ==end== of `main`, matching the opening brace.

# III. Program Mechanics
## ^III-Intro-ProgramMechanics

To create your own C++ programs, you follow a mechanical process, a well-defined set
of steps called the ==**edit-build-run**== **cycle**. In short you:

1. ==Create== your **source code** using an editor
2. ==Build== your executable using a ==**compiler toolchain**==
3. ==Run== your program using your operating system facilities

![[cs150-ch1-3a.png]]

## A. The Build Process [[cs150-ch1#III. Program Mechanics | `III.`]]
Once you have written your source code, the **build process** turns that source code into an executable. It involves several tools: (this is a more complete list than show above)

* ==**Preprocessor**== —performs text substitution on your source code.
* ==**Compiler**==— generates **assembly code** from the preprocessed source code.
* ==**Assembler**==—converts assembly code into **object** or **native machine code**.
* ==**Linker**==—combines machine-code modules into an **executable** that runs.
* ==**Make**==—provides instructions for **building** each program.
* ==**Loader**==—reads the executable from disk into memory and starts it running.
* ==**Debugger**==—runs your program inside a controlled environment.

A **combination** a C++ compiler, linker, assembler and libraries, is known as a [toolchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain). The toolchain we'll use for this course is the Linux GCC 9 toolchain. In an online IDE, like the one in these lessons, you just click the **Run** button to perform all the steps and run the executable. In lecture, you'll look at each of these steps in more detail.

^cs150-ch1-slide-3

```shell
$ g++ hello.cpp
$ ./a.out
hello world
$
```

To use these tools on the **hello world** program:
* Switch to the **Terminal** window (or ==shell==).
* Type `g++ hello.cpp` and press `ENTER`.
* This executes the ==build== process.
* Type `./a.out` which triggers the ==run phase==.

The name default Unix name, `a.out`, stands for ==**assembled output**==.

The tool g++ is often called a compiler, but in fact, it is a driver program, which runs the
different tools in the build process for you, one after another. If you like, you may use
the alternative driver program, clang++, which often provides better error messages
when things go wrong.

Perhaps even better, you can use the make program. Type make hello in the shell and
it will run all of the tools, producing the executable output executable named hello. (Unix
programs typically do not have an extension, like .exe.)

You can run the program by typing ./hello in the shell. Unlike Windows, the current
directory (or folder) is not in the executable path. The ./ means "run the hello program
in the current directory; not some other hello program.

# IV. The CS 150 Homework
## ^IV-Intro-CS150Homework

You'll complete your homework using the ==**CS50 IDE**==. You will set up and configure your IDE in class. If you have not, then contact your instructor.

For each assignment, I'll provide you with a set of "starter files" which provide a framework for running and testing simple C++ programs.

Open the folder for each homework problem by clicking the **arrow to the left of the folder**, to expand its contents. In the screenshot, the `cs150` folder has been expanded, as well as the `hw` folder it contains, and the `h00` folder with its contents.

^cs150-ch1-slide-4

---
Open the source code files (.cpp and .h) by double-clicking the icon in the file explorer.
Each file will ==**open in its own tab.**==

As you edit your source code, ==**save each file**== before trying to compile, run or test.

To save your file, press `CONTROL+S`, or choose `File->Save` from the menu.

## A. The Building Directory [[cs150-ch1#IV. The CS 150 Homework | `IV.`]]
Once you've entered ==**and saved**== your source code, you're ready to **compile** and **link** it.
This is called ==**building**== the program, and is done by running a program named `make`.

Before you can do this, you must be in the correct folder.
This is called the ==**current working directory**==.

You may use the UNIX command `cd` to switch to the correct folder. Assuming you are working on `h00`, the command would look like this:

```Shell
cd
cd workspace/cs150/hw/00
```

In the CS50 IDE, though it is probably easier to right-click the homework folder, and select ==**Open a Terminal Here**== as shown in the screenshot on the right.

If you have your source code file open in the editor, you can just use the short-cut: `ALT+L`. That's what I usually do.

^cs150-ch1-slide-5

---
When you open a new terminal (as opposed to use the terminal at the bottom), it opens
a new tab which hides your source code.
* You may right-click the new terminal tab and choose: Split Pane in Two Columns to move it to the right.
* You can drag the new terminal and drop it on the Console pane at the bottom.

## B. Building Your Program [[cs150-ch1#IV. The CS 150 Homework | `IV.`]]
The `make` program is responsible for building your code. Switch to the terminal, type `make` and then press `ENTER`. This command **compiles** and **links** your program. If all is well, the prompt will reappear and there will be no other output.

>[!missing] No! Wait! Something Went Wrong!!!!
Of course it's possible that your code ==**didn't**== compile successfully.

==**Syntax or compiler**== errors occur when you have broken one of the grammar rules of C++. If that occurs, you'll see an (often inscrutable) error message in the output pane instead. ==**Follow these instructions exactly**== to fix them.

1. Scroll up to the ==**first error that appears**== in the output window and make note of the file name and line numbers.
2. The second line of the error message attempts to show you where the com- piler got confused. In this case, it is right before the literal number **10**.
3. Go to the text editor and **fix the problem** and them save and build again. This is where things get tricky. The compiler **doesn't know** what you **intended** to write, so the solution it recommends is often incorrect. The actual solution in this case is to add the output operator (`<<`) which we've forgotten.

Once you've corrected ==**and saved**== your source code, ==**build again**== to see if you've fixed
the problem. You ==**can't go onto the next step**== until there are no errors.

^cs150-ch1-slide-6

## Running Your Program

Type `make run` and press `ENTER` to **compile**, **link** and **run** your program.

==**Logic errors**== or **bugs** occur when your program **doesn't do what it is supposed to do**. If the output of the program looks like this that shown below, then you have a **logic error**, because you removed a space that was intended to appear in the output according to the homework specification.

## Testing Your Program

To see if the program is correct, you need to ==**test it.**== Testing a program means that you compare the output which your program produces (called the ==**actual output**==) to the output which was specified, (called the ==**expected output**==).

With the CS150 testing framework, there are two kinds of tests: **instructor tests** (which your instructor has written), and **student tests**, which you can write yourself.

^cs150-ch1-slide-7

---
## Instructor Tests
To run the instructor tests, type  `make test`  in the terminal. The test checks to see that you have the correct output for different inputs. Here is the testing output for `H00`.

At the bottom of the run is the score. Make sure that **your ID** correctly appears, and
that the assignment displayed is also correct. The final line is the **completion code**.

For the optional student testing, you'll find instructions in each assignment handout.

## Submitting your Assignment
To submit each problem for credit, type ==**make submit**== from the terminal. You'll receive a confirmation if your submission is accepted.

The [CS 150 Homework Console](https://cs170-console.appspot.com/) allow you to check your past scores and see about future deadlines. Log in with your student login name (e.g. `sgilbert`) and your student ID (including the capital C. e.g. `C0223456`).
